      <p>Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian is a proven and efficacious tool for
the New Evangelization, that is, the teaching and celebrating and living of our
Catholic faith with the enthusiasm and engagement of the first Christians and
the first missionaries to every part of the world. In small communities formed
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 200 **** -->by the parish, Catholics are helped to deepen their own knowledge and love of
Christ, so that they can give an account of their faith to others, especially
those who do not know Christ or have drifted from His friendship. The small
communities are particularly effective in carrying out the catechesis of those
who are new members of the Church. The deepening of faith is secured by the
study of the authoritative sources of the Church’s Magisterium, Her official
teachings, which are presented in a most accessible manner. Through the
discussion of the texts of recent Papal Magisterium, members of the small
communities, under the pastoral guidance of the Vicar of Christ on earth, are
prepared in the best manner possible to be effective heralds and agents of the
New Evangelization.</p>

      <p>To this end the NCCTS in 1985 developed a comprehensive process called the

doing more meaningful ministry in the Church and in the world.</p>

      <p>In many parishes in the U.Srom clergy and laity prompted some changes. A few
users of the CCL felt that the process ought to be made more contemporary to
counter the aggressive secularization of culture. In 1998 changes were made, the
most obvious change was in the title, Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian
(CLCC). The new title was chosen to suggest the tensions Catholics have and will
increasingly have in their struggle to live authentic Christian lives in a
culture hell-bent on its de-Christianization.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately in 1995, Fr. Novak contracted a staph infection during a knee
replacement operation. This event greatly curtailed and slowed down the
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 250 **** -->promotion of the newly named and improved CLCC process. Six years and nineteen
surgeries later, the continuing infection necessitated removal of his right leg
above the knee on Tuesday of Holy Week, April 10, 2001. Functioning on a
prosthetic leg, Fr. Novak is back in action, though with some limitations. This
book, Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian, is written for priests and lay
leaders in parishes strongly drawn to bring God’s people to a deeper knowledge
of the Catholic faith, growth in holiness and commitment to evangelize one’s
family, the parish community and world, with special focus on helping lapsed
Catholics return to the Church.</p>

      <p>Some thirty years ago a seminal idea about a faith formation process was planted
in my psyche. I prayed it “fell on good soil.” Half way through the stretch of
nurturing, a title for the process came to me: Celebrating Life as a Catholic
Christian (CLCC). By no means was the laborious move from idea to reality a
one-man project. The Lord provided a partnership of talented people to help me
advance the project, namely Mr. Bill Sefton, first chairman of the National
Catholic Conference for Total Stewardship (NCCTS). He was a man of exceptional
commitment to the CLCC apostolate, and a friend of nearly five decades. Our two
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 275 **** -->episcopal moderators, Archbishop John F. Donoghue, now emeritus, of Atlanta and
Archbishop Kelvin E. Felix, formerly of St. Lucia in the Caribbean and now in
Grand Bay, Roseau, Dominica, provided their friendly presence faithfully and
their input has always been positive. I thank also all other original donors of
their time and gifts to help define the nucleus of a much-needed “renewal”
apostolate in the Church, the CLCC process.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Ch2.p2">
      <p>The CLCC faith formation process has incalculable potential and requires strong
participant commitment. Inspiring and exemplary commitment has been given by a
small group eager to grow personally in the faith, and eager to spread it by
reaching out to non-practicing, lapsed Catholics. According to the latest
survey, the number of non-church-going Catholics in the U.S. stands at a
staggering 45 million. Helping these millions return to Christ and his Church is
the CLCC’s apostolic outreach. Groups formed in parishes that carry out the CLCC
process are known as Small Ecclesial Faith Communities (SEFC). Members of one
such group have met faithfully on Tuesday evenings without interruption for 4
years in over 200 consecutive ninety-minute Faith Formation Sessions. Their
commitment to the CLCC process is not only transparent, but their growth in
knowledge of the faith and in their spiritual life has been a climb of the
mountain. Lay leaders in this group, noted for their extraordinary dedication
and perseverance, are Rob Winkler, Adelaide Herrell and Kimberly Dowd.</p>

      <p>The CLCC process, we feel confident, is the work of the Holy Spirit. How else
explain the following occurrence? Out of the masses emerged mysteriously a
Michael Bradley, the right man at the right time, a computer professional. He
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 300 **** -->came to help us put the CLCC faith formation Manual into final form for
publication. To Michael Bradley very special and sincere thanks for the amount
of selfless time he has generously donated to the CLCC process, even taking six
weeks off from work. Thanks also to Fr. Brian Van Hove, S.J, Board member of the
NCCTS, for introducing Michael Bradley to us to become part of this
mission. Finally, warm thanks to family and many dear friends, who by their
daily prayers, were in large and small ways instrumental in making the CLCC
faith formation process a successful journey from idea to reality.</p>

    <para xml:id="Ch4.p1">
      <p>1. Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian (CLCC) is a process by which lay
Catholics are formed in spirituality within Small Ecclesial Faith Communities
(SEFC) which are established in and by the parish. In addition to becoming
better formed in the faith, the CLCC process prepares SEFC members to carry out
the critically needed apostolate of reaching out to lapsed, non-practicing
Catholics with the aim of helping them return to the Church. For those who are
willing to join a SEFC for re-introduction to the faith, the faith community
then acts as the staging ground for their re-entry into the Church. Fundamental
to this process is Saint James’ astounding and unequivocal teaching “faith of
itself, if it does not have works, is dead … [F]aith without works is
useless.” (cf. Jas 2:17,20; cf. CCC 1815) Obviously the goal of this process is
to develop faith more deeply in the People of God, and its apostolic outreach is
conversion of fallen-away Catholics for building up the kingdom of God.
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 425 **** -->Recently a saddened father confided to me that five of his six adult children do
not go to Mass on Sunday. All were educated in the best of Catholic schools from
the elementary level to college. All were trained in the faith. “They don’t
deny the faith,” he said,“ they just ignore it, or try to justify their
troubled conscience by saying they don’t ’buy’ it all.”</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Ch4.p2">
      <p>2. This book will show why Pope John Paul II has stressed the need of formation
in holiness and the need of New Evangelization that he describes in several
apostolic letters and exhortations issued during his pontificate. For example in
the apostolic exhortation, Christifideles Laici, “The Lay Faithful of Christ,”
he states that between God who offers his gifts, and the person who receives
them, that person is “called to exercise responsibility, indeed the necessity,
of a total and ongoing formation.” Quoting the Synod Fathers (1988), the Holy
Father writes, “Christian formation (is) a continual process [emphasis added]
of maturation in faith and a likening to Christ in the individual, according to
the will of the Father, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.” The Holy Father
emphasizes that “formation of the lay faithful must be placed among the
priorities of a diocese. It ought to be so placed within the plan of pastoral
action that the efforts of the whole community (clergy, lay faithful and
religious) converge on this goal.” (cf. CL 57)</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Ch4.p3">
      <p>3. The “plan of action” which the Pope has in mind is embodied in this
process. Because Catholics for two or more generations have been minimally
catechized and therefore minimally formed in the faith, the need of sound,
orthodox catechesis is not only imperative but may not be delayed. The RCIA
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 450 **** -->boasts of newcomers and returnees to the faith in the tens of thousands each
year. But in not a few cases because they feel unanchored to the Church many
drift way.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Ch4.p4">
      <p>4. Unique to Small Ecclesial Faith Communities in the CLCC process is that not
only do fallen-away Catholics have a welcome place to come to, but also new

      <p>5. Many conscientious parents express concern when they see in their adolescent
and college age children a faith crisis. Their concern is selection, to which
Catholic school should we send them, since some Catholic schools are “Catholic
in name only.” They see the faith crisis in their own parish: low Mass
attendance, often irreverent liturgies, and certain sex education programs in
their schools which instead of promoting and preserving chastity destroy the
children’s innocence.</p>

      <p>6. The growing priest shortage in both diocesan and religious orders is finally
hitting home. Where will they go for Mass? Hard to believe but true, the priest
shortage began some forty years ago when an admission policy to seminaries was
adopted which has been tabbed as “artificial and contrived.” This means that
screening of applicants favored those who were liberal, “open” and modern. Men
found to be traditional, obedient and prayerful were believed to be “rigid”
and therefore not accepted. The fruits of this policy are being reaped today. We
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 475 **** -->ought never to feel that God is not calling men to the priesthood. He is. For
reasons too numerous to mention here, young men are not responding, but in time
they will. Moreover, the new priests ordained in a given year are far too few to
replace old and ill priests who retire from ministry or die, increasing the
number of “priestless parishes.”</p>

      <p>7. Hope should be our trademark. The SEFC is an ideal environment for a young
man to experience “Church” and discern his vocation to serve it. Members will
help him follow his vocation quest, pray for him, support him and see him to
ordination. “The duty of fostering vocations falls on the whole Christian
community,” stated Pope John Paul II, “and they should discharge it
principally by living full Christian lives.” (cf. PD 41)</p>

      <p>8. “Do something” is the outcry today. A Spirit-filled laity is emerging to do
something about the crisis of faith they see around them. No longer do they feel
comfortable shifting problems to Father or the Bishop. The Holy Spirit is
working in their lives and in families awakening them to the powers that
Baptism, Confirmation and Eucharist impart, especially awareness of their
“right and duty” to participate in the saving mission of the Church. They
learn that to share in the mission of the Church does not give them license to
act independently of the local pastor or of the bishop or pope. Rather they
strive to share responsibility in the Church’s apostolates in friendly
“communion” with the pastor, the designated head and shepherd of the flock.
Part I of this book presents the CLCC process in its 5 stages. Part II, titled
Authoritative Sources consists of passages taken from 20 key teachings of the
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 500 **** -->Church. Both Part I and II present almost inexhaustible material for faith
formation, preaching and the apostolate to the lapsed.</p>

      <p>The Process
1. Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian (CLCC) is a process which
systematically evangelizes God’s people in spirituality. At the same time it
stimulates them to carry out their “missionary duties,” the major one, helping
lapsed, non-church going Catholics return to the Church. In addition to citing
many official Church teachings, this process incorporates a number of the new
initiatives that Pope John Paul II calls for in his apostolic letter, Novo
Millennio Ineunte, “On Entering the New Millennium,” for spreading the Gospel
in the new century.
This process confronts the faith and cultural crisis that currently plagues
millions of Catholics, many of whom seem blissfully unaware of the gravity of
their situation.
By means of New Evangelization and a catechesis for holiness, the CLCC process
aims to give God’s people a bold Catholic identity, a way to live and a way to
help other people live genuinely Christian lives not succumbing to the pressures
of secular society nor to the corrosive influences of anti-Christian and
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 525 **** -->atheistic forces that are corrupting the culture. In opposition to these forces
is this thoroughly Christ-centered CLCC faith formation process. It presents
Jesus’ public ministry in Galilee in five stages, while at the parish level the
CLCC process enacts Jesus’ Galilean ministry in five parallel stages.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Ch5.p3">
      <p>Key People
2. Key people who endorse the process are the priest, pastoral council and heads
of parish organizations. They make a united decision to undertake the CLCC
process in the parish and commit to support it.
Their first job is to select 12 men and women, after the 12 apostles, called the
Matrix. These 12 become the core group of lay persons who lead the process. They
agree to lead the process through its 5 Stages. Their first responsibility is to
learn the process in a general way. As the process unfolds they learn the
specific responsibilities relative to each stage.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Ch5.p4">
      <p>Small Ecclesial Faith Communities
3. The Matrix 12, the core lay leadership group, is the first of many Small
Ecclesial Faith Communities (SEFC) formed in the parish. Many more Small
Ecclesial Faith Communities will follow. Indeed small communities of different
kinds already exist in parishes. However, it is advised and highly useful for
parish community building (“communion”) that existing groups be willing to be
part of the CLCC process. The following and all others are invited and urged to
join: existing bible study groups, prayer groups, religious education
instructors, parish school teachers, the liturgy committee, choir members, the
youth group, young adults, music ministers, the married, single, widowed, the
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 550 **** -->pro-life group, St. Vincent de Paul Society, ushers, greeters, collection
counters, the finance committee, sports directors, maintenance people,
all. There is no one in the parish not in need of further spiritual growth and
updating in his faith. After Jesus “called” the 12 Apostles (cf. Mt 4:18,21;
10:1-4), and “appointed” 72 disciples (cf. Lk 10:1; Mk 3:16), they followed
Jesus to learn his way of life. They grew in the “blessedness” Jesus
proclaimed and exemplified. Jesus formed the first small faith
community. Through the centuries thousands of small faith communities have grown
into “communions,” called dioceses and parishes, which constitute the
infrastructure of the Church, the Body of Christ.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Ch5.p5">
      <p>CLCC is not a Quick-Fix
4. The CLCC is decidedly a process, and not a program! A program has a beginning
and an end, whereas a process is developmental. Through a series of small steps
taken within several stages it advances toward certain desired goals. Unlike
programs, the CLCC process is ongoing. It’s open-ended. Being a process of
formation in holiness and in knowledge of the faith, usually a radical change in
lifestyle begins. The CLCC process is, therefore, not a quick-fix. Saints are
not made overnight. Time is needed for lay leaders and parishioners to get the
process underway. People need time to understand the process and act on it,
especially the astounding prospect of becoming holy. True “spiritual warriors”
who do battle with Satan to save lapsed Catholics need time for solid spiritual
formation. Thus, the CLCC process may not be hurried or short-circuited. Every
temptation to get it over must be banished. Time is the soul of the CLCC
process. Time will show that the process achieves hoped for and measurable
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 575 **** -->results. Personal holiness and zeal for recovering “lost” and lapsed Catholics
cannot be bought online by credit card.</p>

      <p>How to Start the CLCC Process
5. Parishes have a choice of three ways to start the CLCC process.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Ch5.p7">
      <p>A five day mission, Sunday to Thursday, with preaching centered on the meaning
and need of the process and an explanation of the 5 stages, one stage explained
each evening.
A three, four or five day traditional mission on the eternal truths: need of
salvation, the reality of death, judgment, God’s loving mercy, the need of
making a good, integral confession, heaven or hell, and the Blessed Mother.
The parish priest announces the process over several weekends, explaining what
it is, and the absolute usefulness of everyone entering in and belonging to a
Small Ecclesial Faith Community. He emphasizes its twofold focus: catechetical
formation in the faith and in holiness, and outreach to recover lapsed Catholics
who have strayed from the faith. He points out the glory that will be given to
the Lord when all Catholics in the parish, active and alienated, will begin
Celebrating Life as Catholic Christians.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Ch5.p8">
      <p>Holding a mission prior to initiating the process has its advantages, but a
mission is optional. A mission can bring the people to a spiritual “high.” But
to implant a faith formation process in the parish like the CLCC as a follow-up
to a mission is a perfect way to build on the mission’s “high” and its
momentum. In other words, “strike while the iron is hot!” In any case the
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 600 **** -->parish priest’s preaching on the process has value that ought not be
underestimated. Hearing him parishioners will know immediately that he and the
lay leaders alike are making the CLCC a top parish priority.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Ch5.p9">
      <p>Like advertising on TV, parish leaders have a sell job that is non-stop. Those
slow to buy into the process will eventually come around. However parishioners
who for reasons of health, age, handicap or other good reasons cannot join a
SEFC are encouraged to take up the spiritual formation process privately. They
are also urged to pray for the success of the CLCC process, for example, praying
the rosary daily or doing some good work, invoking God’s blessing on all those
entering the process and for a great spiritual awakening in the parish.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Ch5.p10">
      <p>Importance and Necessity of Prayer
6. Jesus said solemnly and emphatically, “Whoever remains in me and I in him
will bear much fruit.” (cf. Jn 15:5) Prayer unites us to the Lord. Prayer
creates a bond between Christ and the person who prays. “For where two or three
are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” (Mt 18:20)
In prayer we come to him, and he comes to us. Through prayer good things happen,
and good things are given us as Jesus promised. Thus, to begin the CLCC process
is one thing. To have the CLCC process “bear much fruit” is another. The
“fruit” is a new level of holiness in all parish members who participate in
the formation process. Holiness is brought about through the experience of
planting, pruning, cultivation and reaping of New Evangelization, orthodox
catechetical formation, holiness, conversion of the lapsed and the return of
many to Christ.
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 625 **** -->Why the emphasis on remaining united to the Lord through prayer? Jesus gives
this straight reply, “because without me you can do nothing.”Jesus’ analogy of
the vine and branches applies to the importance and necessity of prayer. He
said, “I am the vine, you are the branches.” He exhorts, “Remain in me, as I
remain in you.” He warns, “Just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own
unless it remains on the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me.” (Jn
15:4-5) In sum, the CLCC process cannot bear fruit in the parish unless all
persons involved are united to the Lord through the grace-filled power of
prayer.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Ch5.p11">
      <p>Desired Results of the Process
7. What are some of them? When parishioners show greater faith and fervor in
their worship at Mass; when growing numbers of parishioners, by God’s grace,
show real earnestness about living their lives as Catholic Christians; when
after a period of time a detectable air of humility and holiness wafts through
the parish; when a new and fresh spirit of involvement and cooperation become
evident among the People of God.
Evidence of progress in holiness will also be seen when Catholics who have been
away from the sacraments for many years seek reconciliation with the Church
through the sacrament of penance; when new faces begin to appear at Sunday Mass
alongside the regulars, thus increasing Mass attendance; when liturgical
celebration becomes more transcendent and less banal; when people ask for public
adoration of the Blessed Sacrament and come faithfully to make a personal hour
of adoration; when marriage becomes esteemed as a sacred life-long covenant;
when spouses become more forgiving and compatible; when family life becomes more
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 650 **** -->peaceful and stable and children are parent-directed, rather than parents being
directed by children.
As holiness grows among the “actives” in SEFCs, so interest in “missionary
activities” will grow. Awakened will be a sense of responsibility to reach out
to Catholics who are religiously comatose and critically in need of New
Evangelization. The agent of this responsibility is God’s grace. The Holy Spirit
impels them to seek out and help lapsed brothers and sisters to join a SEFC for
return to the Church. The grace-filled actives recover the “lost.” They are
builders of “communion” in the Church. They help bring the Body of Christ to
full stature.</p>

    <para xml:id="Ch5.p12">
      <p>Lay Leaders and Small Ecclesial Faith Communities
Organization
8. Lay leaders of the CLCC process are chosen for having shown some
organizational and management skills. More importantly they possess a strong
desire to grow in personal holiness and in knowledge of the faith and want to
help fellow parishioners do likewise. Recognizing their own hunger for truth and
holiness, they feel certain others experience the same hungers but have not
diagnosed their condition as primarily spiritual rather than psychological,
social, marital or material. Thus leaders are willing to learn and lead a
spiritual conversion process, the CLCC, which is of utmost importance for soul,
mind, heart and body.
Lay leaders first organize themselves. They form the first Small Ecclesial Faith
Community (SEFC). Their main function is to hold weekly spiritual formation
sessions for themselves. In them they learn how to conduct a spiritual formation
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 675 **** -->session, how to use the material in the 5 Stages starting with Stage 1, and
later going into Part II, titled Authoritative Sources. Formation consists of
internalizing the content of each paragraph in each stage following the order
for proper conduct of a session.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Ch5.p13">
      <p>9. Lay leaders in the first SEFC, also called the Matrix 12 after the 12
Apostles, choose from among themselves a Moderator and an Associate
Moderator. They are advised not to “hire” an outside facilitator. Educated,
qualified and motivated people that they are, they can and will become expert
facilitators themselves. Should questions arise, you are welcome to e-mail the
NCCTS at anytime: questions@clcc.info.
Lay leaders are also responsible for initiating in the parish other Small
Ecclesial Faith Communities (SEFC). Like the Matrix 12, SEFCs should ideally
have 12 members. They may have 10 but ought not to go below 7. There is no limit
to the number of SEFCs that can be formed in a parish, the more the better. They
should dot every area within the parish boundaries. Like the Matrix 12, members
of SEFCs “moderate” themselves, choosing persons within the group whom they
feel are best qualified to lead.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Ch5.p14">
      <p>Functions
10. Moderators call and conduct the sessions. They follow strictly the Order for
Conducting Spiritual Formation Sessions (see the next chapter). All members
should be willing and given a chance to take turns moderating a
session. Sessions may be held in people’s homes or in parish
facilities. Experience shows that preference tilts to people’s homes. A private
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 700 **** -->home is less institutional and less threatening to returnees to the faith than a
church meeting hall.
Most important is that the moderator keeps the session on track without
deviation, that is, he stays strictly to the content of the paragraph under
consideration. Allowing participants to wander off track, letting some members
dominate the discussion, to air personal gripes and distract the group from its
spiritual focus – these are sure ways to “kill” the group and destroy the
process.
Moderators are to begin the session at the agreed upon time, giving each member
a chance to briefly share (without coercion) their spiritual insight or
experience with the group. The session must conclude exactly at the agreed upon
time. To go overtime, no matter how lively the discussion, is also a sure way to
“kill” the formation process and the group’s commitment to it.
If some members choose to continue the session’s discussion, they are free to do
so after it concludes. The moderator must conclude the formation session in 90
minutes in consideration of those who have other obligations.</p>

1. Jesus’ three-year public ministry in Galilee was a divinely planned process
of salvation for the whole human race. It is divided into five stages, each
stage is distinguishable from the other, yet each stage is connected to the
other. Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian (CLCC) is a five-stage faith
formation process modeled on Jesus’ public ministry in Galilee. It is designed
for implementation in parishes of the local Church.

          <p>A. What Jesus Did in Galilee
1. The first thing Jesus did in his public ministry in Galilee was to gather
followers and from among them he called and selected 12 apostles. They were
select witnesses of his teachings, his miracles, his way of life and his
communion with the Father in prayer. Through his Passion, Death, Resurrection
and Pentecost, Christ founded his Church, the kingdom of God’s people on earth
as designed by the Father, a kingdom that will last till the end of time through
the sustaining presence and power of the Holy Spirit. In founding his Church on
earth Jesus guaranteed its continuity and triumph despite the fierce powers of
hell raging against it. (cf. Mt 16:18)

          <p>2. The terms “Christian” and “Catholic” were unknown in Jesus’
day. (cf. Acts 11:26) Yet what Jesus was teaching and sharing with his Apostles
and disciples was Celebrating Life as Catholic Christians (CLCC). With their own
eyes and ears they saw and heard the primacy Jesus gave to Commandments of love
of God and love of neighbor. Daily he showed this love by his self-giving to
everyone to the point of exhaustion. They saw the compassion he showed toward
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 875 **** -->repentant sinners and his rebuke to those who exalted themselves; how he
detested hypocrisy, religiosity, pseudo-piety and false worship. In the many
different ways that Jesus dealt with people his followers were to imitate him.

          <p>3. Catholics and other people are immersed in the present-day culture of
secularism and neo-paganism. They need a defense against the barrage of
anti-Christian influences that surround them. They must be armed to deal with
the growing, overt hostility against Christianity, the Catholic Church in
particular, at themselves and the values they live by. Thus, an empowerment

          <p>B. Enacting What Jesus Did in Galilee in the Parish
1. Leadership of the Priest
Jesus chose 12 apostles to assist him in his mission and provided for their
continuing his mission. Likewise the parish priest must find lay persons to
assist him in his mission, an important one, of launching the CLCC process. Pope
John Paul II states that the parish priest is “configured to Christ, the good
shepherd.” (cf. PD 22) It is the pastor who goes out among the sheep and lambs
of his parish. He scans the flock, selects and calls 12 men and women of all age
groups, young, middle aged and older, who can help him carry out the CLCC
process in the parish. They become the lay leaders of the CLCC process. They are
called the Matrix 12.</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch7.Sx1.p23">
          <p>The priest informs the people in the pews about the CLCC process, explains what
it is, and asks for their participation in it. The mission of the lay leadership
group, the Matrix 12, is to learn the process and guide it through its 5 stages,
receiving throughout support and encouragement from the priest and cooperation
from fellow parishioners. For its success the priest’s initiative and active
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 975 **** -->involvement in the process cannot be emphasized enough. Strongly recommended is
that this process becomes a parish priority, taking precedence over less urgent
ministries and parish activities.</p>

become the Matrix 12. He should also pray to be open to the Holy Spirit’s
bidding, that he chooses other gifted parishioners to form SEFCs, and resist the
temptation to select “never say no” workers, favorites or super-involved

process.The first purpose of the CLCC process is to help people attain new
levels of personal and communal holiness in preparation for doing effective
evangelization. The second purpose is missionary, to find and help save the
wayward sheep, lapsed Catholics. Recall the gospel parable of the lost
sheep. “What man among you having a hundred sheep and losing one of them would
not leave the ninety nine in the desert and go after the lost one until he finds
it? When he does find it he calls together his friends and neighbors Rejoice
with me because I have found my lost sheep in just the same way there will be
more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous
people who have no need of repentence.” (cf. Lk 15:4-7)

“Just as the Son was sent by the Father, so too he sent apostles.” (cf. Jn
20:21) The Church has received from the apostles the task to be Christ’s
“witnesses” and proclaim his saving truth “even to the ends of the earth.”
(cf. Acts 1:8) “Hence she makes the words of the Apostle her own: ’Woe to me,
if I do not preach the gospel’ (cf. 1 Cor 9:16), and unceasingly sends heralds
of the gospel [to] carry on the work of evangelizing. The Church is compelled
by the Holy Spirit to do her part towards the full realization of the will of
God, who has established Christ as the source of salvation for the whole
world. By proclamation of the gospel, she prepares her hearers to receive and
profess the faith, disposes them for baptism, snatches them from the slavery of
error, and incorporates them into Christ so that through charity they may grow
up into full maturity in Christ The obligation of spreading the faith is
imposed on every disciple of Christ according to his ability.” [emphasis added]

Most parishes, large, medium-sized and small have a sizable number of persons
who call themselves Catholic, but are in fact lapsed, alienated, non-practicing
Catholics. Many are weak in their knowledge of the faith, and in numerous cases
almost totally ignorant of even the fundamentals of the Catholic Faith.</p>

their rejection by appealing to the principle of “religious freedom.” They
claim their conscience is at peace. Not a few “in name only Catholics” are
graduates of Catholic colleges. They enrolled in the school with shaky faith and
not infrequently left the school with “freedom” not to practice the faith.</p>
        </para>

          <p>Catholics such as these need to be reached, befriended and won back to the
Church. Some may be looking for a way back into the fold. Others may be
closed-minded and resist any invitation to return to the Church. The power of
God’s grace can never be under-estimated. For some, the RCIA program fills their
faith gap. Others, really the majority, need to be brought to a more lively
practice of the Faith through the slower-moving, more in-depth dynamics of Small
Ecclesial Faith Communities where welcome is warm and camaraderie
long-term. Within them results are more predictably measurable.Two outstanding
Pontiffs have explicitly endorsed and promoted small faith communities in their
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 1100 **** -->teachings (cf. Evangelii Nuntiandi, EN, Paul VI, 1975, 58, 60; Redemptoris
Missio, RM, John Paul II, 1990, 51). In faith communities, Church-going
Catholics advance admirably to higher levels of knowledge of their Church’s
teachings and in holiness. Alienated, lapsed and “Christmas and Easter”
Catholics who accept invitations to come into such a community will first
experience bonding with the members; then, by association with them in study,
prayer and sharing, and by the power of God’s grace, they will become disposed
to return to the Church.

          <p>8. Priest’s Mission is “To Beget”
Vatican Council II’s Decree on the Ministry and Life of Priests, states
“Acknowledging Christ’s desire and inspired by the Holy Spirit, the apostles
considered it their duty to select ministers ’who shall be competent in turn to
teach others.’ (2 Tim 2:2) This duty then ’to beget’ is part of the priestly
mission by which every priest is made a partaker in the care of the whole
Church, so that workers may never be lacking for the People of God on earth.”
(PO 11). This statement applies to bishops, successors of the apostles, and to
priests who aid their bishops in the offices of teaching, sanctifying and
governing. Stated here are the basic principles of shared responsibility.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch7.Sx1.p50">
          <p>In their mission priests also share responsibility with the laity, particularly
in the role of teaching: priests teach truth from the pulpit, teachers of
religion form children in the faith in Catholic schools, in the religious
education programs, in the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults, in
preparation for the Sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation, and in the
consultative body called the parish pastoral council. Vatican Council II’s
statement about church leaders, bishops, having the “duty to select ministers
’who shall be competent to teach others,”’ points first to priests. Part of the
priests’ mission is to select competent laypersons to help teach eternal truths
in pastoral work such as in the CLCC process. Theirs is an educational,
formational and spiritual responsibility shared with the bishop.The Decree sums
up shared responsibility in these words, “This duty then is a part of the
priestly mission by which every priest is made a partaker in the care of the
whole Church, so that workers may never be lacking for the People of God on
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 1200 **** -->earth.”(cf. also LG 34-37; CCC 783; RH 19)</p>

mankind. He is the one and only Savior. There is no other. (cf. DI 13) To Peter
and the 12 Apostles he entrusted the great responsibility to carry out his plan
of salvation in the whole world. (cf. Mt 28:18-20; also 16:18) Through the
apostles’ successors, bishops, their helpers, priests, and lay persons, Christ
continues his work, by their preaching the good news, administering the
sacraments to his people, and sharing responsibility with the laity who can
contribute much to the development and spread of the faith of Christ’s Church
throughout the world.

The primary goal of every person who belongs to an SEFC is to strive to advance
in personal holiness through the CLCC faith formation process as given in this
study manual. Formation in holiness of life is based on Jesus’ teachings during
his public ministry, as recorded in the Bible. Members of SEFCs are also formed
in official Church teachings, many of which may relatively unknown to them
(cf. Part II, Authoritative Sources). Jesus’ teachings recorded in the gospels
and the Church’s official teachings interlink. Each participant in an SEFC
should be open “to be evangelized [in order to] evangelize” in his or her
parish; that is, willing, if possible, to do mission outreach to lapsed,
alienated, non-regular church goers, befriend them and invite them to join a
Small Ecclesial Faith Community for conversion to Christ and his Church.

generously to those who ask. It is in the close-knit Small Ecclesial Faith

Church. Through God’s grace Small Ecclesial Faith Communities are the “rich
soil” that “produce(s) a hundred or sixty or thirtyfold.” (cf. Mt 13:8)
Lapsed Catholics are like “the harvest [that] is abundant but the laborers are
few; so [as Jesus urged] ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for
the harvest.” (cf. Mt 9:37-38) To gather in the “abundant harvest,” laborers
for the harvest are needed. Thus, SEFCs are a “must” where laborers are
schooled both in personal holiness and for gathering the harvest.

Catholics have reached astronomic numbers. An estimated 45 million Catholics do
not go to Church regularly in the United States. They need to be reached and won

“To beget” means the “duty” to propagate the kingdom of God for one’s own
salvation and the salvation of others. Jesus’ mission was “to beget.” He
called apostles first, who chose successors (bishops), who then selected priests
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 1475 **** -->to share their care of the Church, and priests in turn seek out lay persons
(workers), so that the people of God are adequately cared for. The pastoral term
for “duties” is shared responsibility. The laity’s duty is to share
responsibility, helping the priest by exercising primarily their prophetic role
of teaching and formation of God’s people in the faith. The CLCC is in fact a
process of “begetting.” Participants train in personal holiness, a quality
that helps them deliver lapsed Catholics into the arms of Mother Church. Pray
to the Holy Spirit to get the impact of these truths. Reflect in quiet. Share
with your SEFC how you see the CLCC as a “begetter” of higher levels of
holiness and of conversion in your parish.</p>

functions are inter-linked to ensure good results. Reflect why and how formation
in personal holiness is a vital prerequisite for doing successful outreach
evangelization to those in need of conversion. Pray to the Holy Spirit for his
gifts. For productive evangelization, all seven gifts of the Holy Spirit need to
be active within you: wisdom, council, knowledge, understanding, fortitude,
piety and fear of the Lord (CCC 1831). Invoke the Lord to energize the Holy
Spirit’s “gifts” in you. Share the light you receive.</p>

          <p>10. Catechetical Instruction Holds Primacy of Place in SEFCs
Small Ecclesial Faith Communites are invaluable for parishes. Parishioners in
great part are in need of a booster shot of truth. Too often, they are strangers
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 1500 **** -->to each other, having time only for a quick “Hi” as they rush to the parking
lot after Sunday Mass. SEFCs have two purposes. First to invite, draw and
convince “Hi Catholics” that SEFCs are also for them. Systematic formation in
the faith is necessary for them, and for their own growth in personal holiness
perhaps a stunning surprise. The second purpose is that members of SEFCs do not
stop with “interior formation.” They are expected to follow up with an
“exterior action,” to reach out to and help save lapsed Catholics return to
the Church. This was Jesus’ mode of operation in Galilee. He called apostles,
formed them in his truths by his preaching (interior formation), then sent them
out two by two (exterior action) to towns and villages to teach, preach, convert
and drive out demons. The CLCC process is modeled on Jesus’ method of
evangelizing. See the centerfold, page #. Invoke the Holy Spirit for
light. Reflect in quiet on the remarkable parallel between Jesus’ form of
evangelizing in Galilee and the CLCC’s corresponding form of evangelizing in the
parish. Share the insights the Holy Spirit gives you.</p>

1. Jesus’ public ministry began when he called 12 men whom he named
Apostles. From a growing number of followers he “appointed” 72 disciples. He
brought them together. They formed community, heard his teachings and were
“insiders” to his new way of life. They were eyewitnesses of his miracles and
his power to expel demons and the way he went about accomplishing his messianic
mission. He had two purposes in mind: to form them to live in community with
him, and after a period of formation in his way of life he sent them to share
the good news first in local Galilee and after Pentecost into the whole world.</p>

Catholic faith and who feel drawn to do some kind of meaningful apostolic work,
such as the CLCC faith formation process. Simultaneously, they receive
preparation for and motivation to do this outreach ministry, the aim being to
help non-practicing Catholics return fully to Christ and his Church.</p>

1. Meaning of these terms
Community is a group or class of people who bond together because they have a
common interest, a cause or special purpose, e.g. neighborhood watch, the
family, home-schooling parents, a college community, a parish, a diocese, a

          <p>Communio (Latin) is the action of the Holy Spirit, the divine, invisible agent
of heaven and earth bonding God’s people into the Body of Christ, making it the
Church through the sacraments of Baptism, Eucharist, Confirmation and the gift
and virtue of faith.
Communion is the visible reality, people spiritually bonded who pursue the
reason for their existence, namely to become holy and reach out to others in
missionary activity.

Vatican’s Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith has stated that the concept

(communion with God) and the horizontal (communion among men).”</p>

          <p>The “vertical” is the up and down dimension, God intervening in peoples’ lives

liturgy and share the same goals and values. This kind of “communio” among

          <p>3. St. Paul gave us the analogy that the Church is the Body of Christ (1 Cor
12:12), an expression that is well known to us. It means that it is the
Eucharist that transforms us into one body. Thus, the Body of Christ is at once
a visible communion (e.g. the assembly of worshipers at Sunday Mass, SEFCs and
other groups) and an invisible communion when believers share the one, true
faith, which resides in their minds, souls and hearts. Invisible communion binds
together the pilgrim church on earth, the heavenly church already united with
Christ in heaven, and the church in purgatory waiting to be fully purified. The
Body of Christ is the union of the three churches. In the creeds we profess them
as the communion of saints. (cf. CCC 954)
In addition to the infinite sacrifice of Christ on the Cross and his
intercession for us before the Father, the saints and in particular the Virgin
Mary, Mother of God, also pray for us. Thus the communion of saints is a
communion of love and caring between the Church in heaven and the pilgrim church
on earth. (cf. CCC 956)

relationship with the Apostles and all humanity was forever confirmed at the
foot of the Cross (“Woman, behold your son”), and then sealed on Pentecost
when, with the Apostles, Mary received an outpouring of the Holy Spirit’s
abundant graces, spiritual gifts and charisms. From that day till the end of
time Mary plays a key role in the apostles’ ministry and in all apostolates of
the Church. (cf. Acts 2)

          <p>2. Matrix comes from the Latin word, mater, meaning mother. Matrix is a
generative term. It means that something originates in or develops from
something that already is. Mary was a virgin living in Nazareth. The angel
announced to her that she would “bear a son” by the overshadowing of the Holy
Spirit, and he would be “called Son of the Most High.” Mary became
“incarnate” with the Son of God (cf. Lk 1). Mary conceived this Child by the
Holy Spirit. Having developed in her womb, after nine months she delivered the
Christ-Child in Bethlehem. The Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, Jesus, who
existed from all eternity at a given time took on humanity in the womb of Mary
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 1650 **** -->as God-Man. Thus the term matrix fittingly applies to Mary.

          <p>3. How does the term matrix apply to the Matrix 12? Through weekly, systematic
formation in official Church teachings, they become “incarnate” with
Christ. By receiving the sacraments, praying and sharing, they develop further
in Christ. Formation takes place in their Small Ecclesial Faith
Community. “Delivery” means they begin setting up other Small Ecclesial Faith
Communities in the parish, starting with one, then a second, a third and adding
more till all the parishioners belong to a SEFC. Parishioners who enter a SEFC
and participate in the CLCC process can be likened to conception in the
womb. There they are “formed” in holiness and prepared for mission. After a
time they “deliver.” They reach out to lapsed Catholics in the parish.

The Church bestowed on Mary the title, Mother of the Church, because she is
eminently deserving of it through her deep faith (Annunciation, cf. CCC 965,
969), her martyr-like suffering (Calvary, CCC 964), her unbounded prayer and
charity as Mother of the Risen Christ (Pentecost, CCC 965) and her singular
glory (Assumption, CCC 966).

our Mother, the Mother of every human being. How did this phenomenon, so
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 1675 **** -->fortunate for us, come about? According to the Catechism of the Catholic

By her complete adherence to the Father’s will, to her Son’s redemptive work,
and to every prompting of the Holy Spirit, the Virgin Mary is the Church’s model
of faith and charity. Thus she is a “pre-eminent and wholly unique member of
the Church”; in fact, she is the “exemplary realization” (typus = type) of
the Church.</p>

she is a mother to us in the order of grace.”</p>

          <p>6. The phenomenon is summarized in this way. “This motherhood of Mary in the
order of grace continues uninterruptedly from the consent which she loyally gave
at the Annunciation and which she sustained without wavering beneath the cross
until the eternal fulfillment of all the elect. Taken up to heaven she did not
lay aside this saving office, but by her manifold intercession continues to
bring us the gifts of eternal salvation. Therefore the Blessed Virgin Mary is

Mary. “The Church in her apostolic work, (for example, carrying out the CLCC
process in a parish or diocese), also rightly looks to her who brought forth
Christ … so that through the Church Christ may be born and grow in the hearts
of the faithful also. The Virgin Mary in her own life lived an example of that
maternal love by which all should be fittingly animated who cooperate in the
apostolic mission of the Church on behalf of the rebirth of men.” (LG 65)</p>

the Church is charged with words such as “brought forth,” “born,”
“rebirth.” Other life-giving words such as revitalization, recycling, renewal
and renaissance are contained in the arch-symbolic term aggiornamento, which
means, “beginning anew.” This is the term Blessed Pope John XXIII used in his
address at the opening of the Second Vatican Council on Saturday, October 20,
1962 in Rome. Thus, when a pastor and his Matrix 12 initiate the CLCC process in
the parish they are “beginning” its “rebirth,” aggiornamento.

tremendous muscle to the faith-quality in themselves and to the People of
God. They take their clue from the way Jesus sized up the religious condition of
the people in his day. They were starving for the good news of the Messiah. Thus
he exclaimed, “The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few; so ask the
master of the harvest to send out laborers for the harvest.” (Lk 10:2)

They become laborers of the abundant harvest. Using the words of John Paul II,
Matrix leaders and members of SEFCs need to be evangelized [in order] to
evangelize. (emphasis added) (cf. CL 51)
“To be evangelized” means that the Matrix 12 and members of SEFCs are formed
in the faith more deeply, and become better acquainted with the authoritative
teachings of the Church as given in official Church documents (cf. Part II of
this book) and the Catechism of the Catholic Church. The first aim is to grow in
holiness, a fundamental prerequisite for doing effective evangelization.

second purpose of the CLCC process. They reach out to lapsed, non-church going
Catholics, also former Catholics in an effort to win them over and join a
SEFC. Through association with the CLCC members in a SEFC, the lapsed are
introduced again to the faith through magisterial and catechetical
formation. All-important for them is to be open to the gentle prodding of the
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 1750 **** -->Holy Spirit. He will give the person a good feeling toward the Church and a
desire to “come home.”

memorized and indelibly marked in one’s store of CLCC convictions. Pope John
Paul II uttered the statement on Sunday, October 19, 2003 when he beatified in
Rome the world-renowned missionary-evangelizing nun, Mother Teresa of Calcutta,
before a massive crowd of 300,000 people. Speaking of her extraordinary
holiness, he said categorically and concisely, “Sanctity is the secret of
evangelization and of all genuine spiritual renewal.”

          <p>5. The reason for the CLCC’s dual purposes is that church leaders, clergy and
laity, especially in large, long established parishes tend to feed the sheep in
the fold but fail, due to being understaffed, to go after the strays and
lost. Who can deny that sometimes not a few nominal Catholics live within the
parish boundaries, some only a few blocks away, who do not know Christ and know
little about the Church.</p>

meager and superficial religious education. Now as adults they ignore the
Church, have lost interest in it, feel it has nothing to offer them, and some
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 1775 **** -->may harbor anger toward it. These kinds of Catholics number in the
millions. They need “disciples,” “laborers” from SEFCs to find and visit
them, speak to them kindly, provide a setting for the Holy Spirit to touch their
hearts, and begin the slow process of gathering them in an abundant harvest.

          <p>6. Why “Ecclesial” Communities?
Small communities called “base communities” (communidades de base) had their
origin largely in South America in the past century. In a sense they are the
predecessors of faith communities in the United States. The nature and focus of
faith communities have gone through many ups and downs: some because their
purpose was not clearly defined, others for being top heavy with unworkable
internal structures, some lacked the missionary spirit, and there were other reasons.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch8.Sx1.p31">
          <p>Pope Paul VI explains clearly why small communities, if they are to be regarded
as true faith communities, must have an “ecclesial” connection, that is, must
be identifiable as spiritual and religious. They must be distinguished for their
“worship, deepening of faith, fraternal charity, prayer [and] contact with
pastors.” (emphasis added) He said that communities that claim to “remain
within the unity of the Church,” but in fact are “hostile to the hierarchy”
(is) a misuse of terms. Then definitively the Holy Father states, “groups
which come together within the Church in order to unite themselves to the the
Church and to cause the Church to grow” will be “a hope for the Universal
Church.” (cf. EN 58)</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch8.Sx1.p32">
          <p>Small faith communities of various kinds, however, do exist in many parishes in
the United States. For participants they have considerable social, educational,
religious and pragmatic value. Here in the United States due to the severe
breakdown of social interchange and decline of neighborliness many people are
“too busy” to talk to each other, such as married couples, parents and
children, relatives and friends. But other factors enter in. The materialistic
and secular culture in which we live makes small faith communities a virtual
necessity for survival and preservation of personal sanity. In them people
experience humanness, their dignity as persons is respected, and their religious
faith is not downgraded but strengthened.</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch8.Sx1.p33">
          <p>These are priceless qualities of soul that kindred spirits can and do share with
each other. Small faith communities are refreshing havens where people enjoy
sincere, not false fellowship. Being with loving, trustful persons they can
disclose and discuss personal, family, marital, social, and religious concerns,
including political issues. Most importantly members of authentic faith
communities will experience the warm congeniality of communal prayer (people
praying together) and not feel embarrassed.</p>

In his encyclical letter, Mission of the Redeemer (Redemptoris Missio, RMiss),
Pope John Paul II states forcefully that small faith communities must be
“ecclesial.” “Ecclesial base communities,” he writes, must be “good centers
for Christian formation and missionary outreach.” A papal one-liner, it could
be said, that describes the CLCC process! These “groups of Christians,” he
continues, “… come together for prayer, Scripture reading, catechesis and
discussion of human and ecclesial problems with a view to common commitment.”
He adds reassuringly that such communities “are a sign of vitality within the
Church, an instrument of formation and evangelization and a solid starting point
for a new society based on a ’civilization of love.”’ (RMiss 51) What a
blessing that the CLCC process has been able to appropriate these Church
teachings!

          <p>8. Why the emphasis on “ecclesial?” Not only are parishes well served by
having many functioning small faith communities, but they are best served when
the communities are strongly knitted to the parish and committed to advancing
the goals of the parish mission statement, especially through the CLCC faith
formation process. Union with the parish heightens “communion” within the
parish. Members of SEFCs help raise the level of holiness among other parish

for the poor and neglected, and of commitment to the transformation of

the Eucharist, lives in a communion marked by oneness of heart and soul, and

The general aims of associations are “to evangelize and sanctify … to infuse

Matrix 12 and members of SEFCs. The formation is at once spiritual, doctrinal
and missionary. All laypersons in the parish are cordially invited, in fact,
urged to participate in the CLCC process by becoming members of a SEFC.

The introduction of Stage Two is a summary of Stage One and a review of the many
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2075 **** -->implications which Christ’s “call” to the 12 apostles and 72 disciples has for
us in our day. The work of Stage One is to enact in the parish what Jesus did in
Galilee: he gave formation in doctrine and designation of mission. Turn to the
centerfold of this book, page #. Study the parallel between the five stages of
Jesus’ public ministry and the five stages of the CLCC process.</p>

          <p>Enactment of the process in a parish begins with the priest (the Christ
figure). He selects a core lay leadership group called the Matrix (a figure of

Stage 2 has to do with Formation. When the apostles through their own free will
chose to answer Jesus’ call to follow him, they had no idea what they were
getting into, except that they were attracted to Jesus, liked what they heard
him say and apparently were dissatisfied with their occupations. The “12” and
“72” became a group of men who had something in common: their desire to follow
Christ.</p>

Cardinals (one was held in pectore, in the Holy Father’s heart) the cardinal’s
ring, a sign of dignity, solicitude and solid communion with the “See of
Peter”. In his homily he described, “the Church as one People of God rooted in

of God was carried and developed in the womb of the Virgin Mary. The Matrix 12,
the lay leadership group, begin their formation by holding weekly sessions in
the CLCC process in their Small Ecclesial Faith Community. After a short time
they begin to “deliver”, that is, bring forth other SEFCs in the rest of the

allocution at the end of the third session of Vatican Council II on November 21,

“to bring us the gifts of eternal salvation.” This flood of graces flows from
her “fiat” in Nazareth to be the Mother of God. Reflect on the flood of graces

forth Christ to its members, to families, parishes, dioceses and the Universal
Church. Reflect on Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian, a premier apostolic

1. The first statement under C.1. presents a huge challenge to the Matrix 12 and
to SEFCs. God’s people were starving for the good news of the Messiah. Jesus
said, “The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few.” Reflect on how the

College of Cardinals honored the Holy Father on his 25th year as Pope. In his
talk to them he made a strong plea for holiness of life, and love of the poor
and weak. In his talk on Sunday, October 19, before the massive crowd squeezed
into St. Peter’s square for the beatification of Mother Teresa of Calcutta, he
recalled her concise statement and proclaimed it: “Sanctity is the secret of
evangelization and of all genuine spiritual renewal.” Let this statement ring
long in our minds and hearts. It demands our most serious reflection on the

The first paragraph in the main text is background material stating that small
communities originated mostly in South America. Today, small communities of
every imaginable kind are formed but are neither of “faith” nor “ecclesial.”
Although only a few now the future of SEFCs is promising. The parish is a large
ecclesial faith community. Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian is a process
which promotes “small” ecclesial faith communities within the parish. Members

<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2225 **** -->befriended, given recognition and invited into an SEFC where they will
experience social welcome and begin their journey with others toward higher
levels of holiness and reaching out to the lapsed. For understanding of this

The Popes are strong on the establishment of small faith communities in the
Church. They insist that they be solidly religious and culturally productive to
the joiners and to those whom they aim to serve. Members must be strongly
focused on growing in authentic Catholic truth. They must attached to the
parish, thereby contributing to its overall apostolic mission. Small Faith
Communities are “ecclesial” when they are connected with and attached to the
parish. Reflect on your SEFC. Do you feel it is “a sign of vitality” in your

Vatican Council II’s Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity goes further. Women,
it says, “have an ever more active share in the whole of society [and] in
various fields of the Church’s apostolate.” It says that pastors need the
laity, women and men, to make their apostolate more effective. Take special note
of this statement: “They [the laity] lead to the Church people who perhaps are
far removed from it.” Clearly, church authority is saying that an imperative
pastoral activity is for laypersons to reach out to and help lapsed Catholics
return to the Church. In fact, this is the prime exterior action of lay persons
in the CLCC process.</p>

Decree gives to the laity. They should work closely with their priests,
collaborate with real energy and commitment in parish undertakings (such as the
CLCC process), and consider it “a duty and honor” to give back a part of
themselves to the Lord. Let the Spirit enlighten you on the immense good you do

Catholic. It invites, in fact pleads, with you, the laity, to take up your
“proper roles in building up the Church.” Remember, however, that your
formation becomes authentic and your activity fruitful in the CLCC process only

a new level of holiness through theological, scriptural and magisterial

in personal sanctity. Simultaneously, they are formed to do apostolic works,
which is service to the Church. The service laypersons are expected to do
through the CLCC process is winning lapsed Catholics and those who have strayed
from the Church back into the Church.</p>

          <p>Introduction
1. Stage 3 of this process, Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian (CLCC),
focuses on Stewardship of our Gifts. Fundamental to stewardship is that
recognition be given the Lord who pours out his gifts on his creatures in
inestimable abundance. Added to the gifts given mankind is yet another gift:
“dominion,” understood as sovereignty over our gifts, a sovereignty that is
not absolute but has limits. (cf. CCC 373,2415)
When gifts are freely given certain obligations fall on the one who receives
them: the duty to acknowledge them as coming from God and not ourselves, manage
them wisely and use them in a manner pleasing to God. Thus, for the gifts we
receive, certain religious and moral obligations are imposed: that we

          <p>Stewardship of our Gifts implies more
2. Because God’s gifts are so many and varied and come in a continuous flow, we
tend to take many for granted, for example the everyday gifts of the air we
breathe, the water we use, the sunshine that lights our day. There are also
personal gifts that are unique to us and no one else.
These we often accept without even fleeting awareness of where they came from or
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2400 **** -->who gave them. These are the gifts of life, health, and capacity to think,
understand, read, study and retain, to find a job, provide food and have a house
to call home. Ultimately the chief agent of all gifts, those given in abundance
or in lesser supply, is the Lord, who is the just distributor of all gifts. He
gives them to each person not equally but according to his infinite wisdom for
each person’s ultimate well being. (cf. Mt 25:14-30, also Mt 20:9-16)</p>

          <p>3. Pre-eminent of all the categories of God’s gifts are the supernatural gifts
of faith, hope and charity, faith being the foundational gift without which the
practice of religion is not possible. (cf. Heb 11:6) The gift of faith enables
us to “give free assent to the whole truth that God has revealed.” (cf. CCC
150). As a gift received from God, faith is a supernatural virtue that he
infuses into a person’s soul, mind and heart. (cf. CCC 153) It is cultivated
through prayer, and prayer obtains more grace from God who helps the person
strive to love Him, serve his neighbor and advance in holiness.</p>

          <p>God is good and generous beyond words
4. The abundance of his gifts and graces should prompt us not only to give him
prayerful thanks but also to realize that God gives his gifts freely without our
deserving or meriting them. God’s gratuitous giving should lead to a humble
realization urging us to give him more praise and thanksgiving.</p>

          <p>5. Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian is therefore an aggregate of many
elements. They belong to and come under the encompassing concept of Total
Stewardship that is the bedrock of the CLCC process. This phrase is in fact an
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2425 **** -->arch-symbol. It expresses the three pervasive components of the bible. It is not
limited to buzzwords and even reaches beyond the popular concepts of “time,
talent and treasure,” used for gaining certain pastoral ends.
Rather the phrase, Total Stewardship, expresses the three inseparably linked
components of the written word of God: evangelization, discipleship and
service. As responsible stewards of our gifts, we are to use these gifts for the
building of the kingdom of God on earth. This use of our gifts entails spreading
the good news (evangelization), becoming a committed follower of Christ
(discipleship), and aiding our neighbor as far as we can in his every need
(service). Together the three components add up to not partial but Total
Stewardship. Harmonizing the three components in one’s life is to Celebrate Life
as a Catholic Christian.
6. Lastly, all of God’s gifts, though freely given, have a string attached to
them: accountability. An accounting must be given to the Lord how the gifts
received have been used, how they were increased, what good works they produced,
and how the receiver advanced toward the Giver in love and holiness or regressed
from him through irresponsible behavior. (cf. Mt 25.31-46)</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p7">
          <p>A. God’s Word, First of His Greatest Gifts
1. God’s gifts are situated in several strata of importance, lesser gifts rising
to the highest of gifts, the word of God, where God the Father reveals himself
through his Son, Jesus, the God-Man, who is the WORD. (Jn 1:1) The apostles and
disciples were indeed systematically formed in the great truths, which Jesus
proclaimed about his Father and himself.
But not infrequently the truths were so radically new the disciples failed to
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2450 **** -->understand what Jesus was talking about. Many times Jesus had to take them aside
and in private give them a fuller explanation of his teaching. Despite the
clarification, often the disciples still failed to get the full impact of his
message.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p8">
          <p>2. The episode when Jesus spoke “privately” to four of his apostles took place
on the Mount of Olives. (cf. Mk 13:3) He told them of the destruction of the
temple in Jerusalem, its meaning for the “end time,” the coming persecution,
the great tribulation, the coming of the Son of man, the lesson of the fig tree,
and the need for watchfulness. (cf. Mk 13:1-37) Jesus spoke of all these future
happenings publicly but in parables. For other significant passages where Jesus
explains difficult teachings to his disciples privately, see Mt 17:19; Mk 9:28;
Lk 10:23.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p9">
          <p>3. Among Jesus’ many parables one stands out. In it he shows that the most
important and greatest of God’s gifts is the word of his Father, which he came
to earth to proclaim and to die for on the cross. He describes the gift in
dramatic images. It is the parable of the sower and the seed. (Mk 4:1-20)
Perhaps nowhere in the New Testament does the Lord God announce his word more
explicitly and interpret it most precisely to the crowds than the parable of the
sower and the seed.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p10">
          <p>4. At the Sea of Galilee Jesus got into a boat, seated himself in it and staying
near the shore, began to teach a very large crowd gathered around him on
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2475 **** -->land. Mark’s gospel states, “he taught them at length in parables.” Then he
startled them. He struck upon a parable that froze them with attention. “Hear
this!” he said. “A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seed fell on
the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Other seed fell on rocky ground
where it had little soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not
deep. And when the sun rose, it was scorched and it withered for lack of
roots. Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it and it
produced no grain. And some seed fell on rich soil and produced fruit. It came
up and grew and yielded thirty, sixty and a hundredfold.” He added, “Whoever
has ears to hear ought to hear.” (Mk 4:3-9)</p>

          <p>5. Puzzled about the meaning of the parable, the Twelve along with others
questioned Jesus “alone” about the meaning of the parable. Jesus is the
sower. The seed is God’s word, and God’s word is Christ. “In the beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” (cf. Jn 1:1) Then
Jesus, the Word, describes in four descriptive analogies how his word would and
would not be received by those who hear it. Jesus explained:</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p12">
          <p>Mark 4:15
Some fell “on the path where the word was sown.” “As soon as they hear the
word, Satan comes at once and takes away the word sown in them.”
vv. 16-17
Some was “sown on rocky ground.” These are the ones “when they hear the word,
receive it at once with joy. They have no root; they last only for a time. Then
when tribulation or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2500 **** -->away.”
vv. 18-9
Seeds “sown among thorns are another sort. They are the people who hear the
word, but worldly anxiety, the lure of riches, and the craving for other things
intrude and choke the word, and it bears no fruit.”
v. 20
But seeds “sown on rich soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and
bear fruit thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.”
6. The centrality of the word in God’s great plan of salvation ought neither be
denied nor underestimated. This is why the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine
Revelation, Dei Verbum (henceforth cited as DV) states clearly that “the word
of God, which is the power of God for salvation to everyone who has faith, is
set forth and displays its power in a most wonderful way in the writing of the
New Testament.” (DV 17)
Moreover, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, CCC 124 teaches that these
writings “hand on the ultimate truth of God’s Revelation. Their central object
is Jesus Christ, God’s incarnate Son: his acts, teachings, Passion and
glorification, and his Church’s beginning under the Spirit’s guidance.”
Therefore, the Christian faith is the religion of the “Word” of God, a word
that is as St. Bernard preached “not a written and mute word, but the Word
which is incarnate and living.” (CCC 108)</p>

          <p>7. The Word is Necessary for Formation of Conscience
a. What is conscience?
Conscience is like an ADT alarm system built into a person’s heart to sound
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2525 **** -->caution to avoid evil and encourage it to choose what is good.
b. Conscience can be likened to a restaurant menu
You have choices to select which food you feel is good to eat and turn down
foods that you don’t want to eat.
c. Conscience is like a magnet
It draws you to truth, to God the Supreme Truth, to accept his Commandments as
the ultimate etiquette of proper conduct toward God and one’s neighbor.
d. Conscience is also like a “voice”
That is, a conduit through which God speaks to persons with gentle
authority. The prudent person keeps his conduit open to “hear” all the Lords
messages, which guide him to do good and avoid evil. (cf. CCC 1777)
e. Explaining Conscience
Because conscience is a voice in the inmost being of a person, its function is
to prod a person to make judgments, choices, to do good and avoid evil. These
are called “moral” judgments because conscience prods the person to choose
what is good and reject what is evil. Thus, the Church speaks of a moral
conscience.
f. Forming a Right Conscience
Conscience is formed primarily through education from infancy and childhood to
the end of adulthood. In fact a good, well-formed conscience seeks not only to
do good and avoid evil, but is constantly in search of truth. This means that it
“formulates its judgments according to reason, in conformity with true good
willed by the wisdom of the Creator.” (cf. CCC 1783)
g. The education of conscience
“This is indispensable for human beings who are subjected to negative
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2550 **** -->influences and tempted by sin to prefer their own judgment and to reject
authoritative teaching.” (CCC 1783) Some samples of negative influences:
tolerance, diversity, being non-judgmental, political correctness, “I’m against
abortion but pro-choice,” relativism (there are no absolutes), subjectivism (I
can do what I want if it feels good).
Education of conscience is more than listening to a half hour talk on conscience
in the parish hall during Lent. Educating our conscience consist of a continuous
search for what is true and right, and obeying it, “a life-long task.” (CCC
1784)
h. Erroneous Conscience
The opposite of a well-formed conscience is an erroneous conscience. This kind
of conscience makes bad judgments due to ignorance. Ignorance can be culpable,
that is blameworthy: the person is responsible for the wrong he commits despite
his ignorance. He is responsible because he refuses to learn the truth about
what is right or wrong, or rationalizes about it, or rejects the truth
outright. Thus the person is guilty of the sin he commits. On the other hand
ignorance can be invincible. This means the person, not knowing the nature of
his evil act, is not responsible for the guilt of his act even though the act
committed is sinful. Such a person has a serious obligation to learn the truth,
correct his moral error and cultivate a good and right moral
conscience. (cf. CCC 1790-1794)</p>

          <p>8. Examination of Conscience
a. To prepare for the Sacrament of Reconciliation, it is necessary and useful to
examine one’s conscience in the light of God’s word. The best biblical passages
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2575 **** -->to use for an examination of conscience are the Ten Commandments, the moral
catechesis of the Gospels, especially the beatitudes, and St. Paul’s
letters. (cf. Gal 5:19-21; also cf. CCC 1852) The Catechism of the Catholic
Church gives three lists of the 10 Commandments, the list in the Book of Exodus
20.2-17, the list given in the Book of Deuteronomy 5.6-21, and the traditional
list given in catechisms. It is highly recommended that you open your CCC to

Commandments is as follows:</p>

You shall not kill.
You shall not commit adultery.
You shall not steal.

You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife.
You shall not covet your neighbor’s goods.</p>

kingdom of heaven. (3) Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2600 **** -->comforted. (4) Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the land. (5) Blessed
are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be
satisfied. (6) Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy. (7)
Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God. (8) Blessed are the
peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God. (9) Blessed are they who
are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven. (10) Blessed are they when they insult you and persecute you and utter
every kind of evil against you [falsely] because of me. (11) Rejoice and be
glad, for your reward will be great in heaven. Thus they persecuted the prophets
who were before you. (12) See also Lk 6:20-26.</p>

1. Sacramental celebration in the Church consists of various sacred signs and
symbols drawn from the revealed word of God, which are used to encounter Jesus
Christ in acts of worship.
Signs for the most part are physical
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2625 **** -->2. Examples are the Sign of the Cross and the sign of peace at Mass. Making the
Sign of the Cross is external language, which says we believe in, and have a
loving relationship with the three Divine Persons of the Blessed Trinity. The
sign of peace shows the fraternal communication we have with one another in
Christ. When the priest holds his hands outstretched over the bread and wine
immediately prior to the consecration this is a visible and physical sign of
calling the Holy Spirit to effect transubstantiation. (cf. CCC 1145-1146)</p>

          <p>3. Symbols
Man is God’s most exalted creature of all visible and animate creation. He is
exalted because he is made in the “image” of God. Thus, God speaks to him
through the material cosmos.
Light and darkness
Christ is the Light. (Jn 1:4-9; 8:12; 9:5; 12:46) Satan is Christ’s archenemy
who is the agent of darkness. (Mk 4:15; Mt 4:10; Lk 10:18)
Wind and Fire
In these symbols the Holy Spirit came to the Apostles and Mary on Pentecost
Sunday. (Acts 2:2-4)</p>

Jesus’ baptism in the Jordan River was a symbol of our baptism in Christ giving
us birth in the divine life of the Spirit. (CCC 694; Mt 3:16; Jn 3:5; Col 3:27)
Earth, our Exile, is the place of pilgrimage where the “people of the poor”
await and prepare for Christ’s coming through purification according to the Holy
Spirit. (cf. CCC 710, 716)
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2650 **** -->Fruits
Fruits are a symbol of the innumerable gifts of God in material creation and
spiritual re-creation. (cf. Num 18:12) Eating the forbidden fruit on tree of
knowledge of good and evil is the symbol of sin. (cf. Gen 2:17)
“First Fruits,” the best of the harvest, were offered to the Creator in humble
thanksgiving for his bounty: sheaves of wheat, grapes from the vineyards, wine,
olives, figs, flocks and herds. (cf. CCC 1334-1335) The quantity of the produce
offered to the Creator was the tithe, a tenth part of the product. (cf. Deut 14:22-27)</p>

          <p>“First Fruits” and first-born have like connotations. In regard to the Lord’s
incarnation, passion, death and Resurrection Paul writes, “Now Christ has been
raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.” (1 Cor
15:20) Again Paul states, Christ is “the firstborn of all creation” (Col
1:15), “he is before all things … he is the head of the body, the church. He
is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he himself
might be preeminent.” (Col 1:15,17-18) Christ is “the firstborn of the dead
and ruler of the kings of the earth.” (Rev 1:5)</p>

          <p>4. More Symbols
Washing and “purifications”
Examples: Jesus washed the feet of the apostles. (Jn 13:8,14) The priest washes
his hands (“lavabo”) after he receives the prepared gifts brought to the
altar.
Anointing
This symbol is usually associated with the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation,
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2675 **** -->Holy Orders and the healing Sacrament of the Sick. It signifies the presence and
power of the Holy Spirit coming to the person receiving the sacrament. (cf. CCC
695)
Bread and Wine
At the Last Supper Jesus took bread and wine, gave thanks, blessed them and
pronounced the words of consecration changing the bread into his Body and the
wine into his Blood. Jesus multiplied the loaves enough to feed five
thousand. This miracle pre-figures the great mystery of the Eucharist (Mt
14:13-21; 15:32-39; cf. CCC 1335)
Breaking of Bread
This action was part of the Jewish meal. During the Last Supper Jesus also
“broke the bread” before distributing it to the apostles. (cf. CCC 1329) Jesus
must have done something significant in the breaking of the bread. On the Sunday
evening of Jesus’ Resurrection the two disciples walking with Jesus to Emmaus
recognized him in the “breaking of bread.” (Lk 24:30) When celebrating the
memorial of Jesus’ Passion and Resurrection, the new Christians referred to it
as “the breaking of the bread.” (Acts 2:42)</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p24">
          <p>The Cup
Jesus’ whole life from the Incarnation to his death on the Cross was an offering
of himself to the Father for men’s sins. At the beginning of his passion in the
Garden of Gethsemani, Jesus had a vision of the mountain of sin that he would
atone for by his death. Peter thought he might protect Jesus from arrest, but
the Lord said to him, “Put your sword into its scabbard. Shall I not drink the
cup which the Father has given me?” (Jn’ 18:11; CCC 607) In the words of
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2700 **** -->institution at Mass the priest says over the chalice filled with wine, “This
cup which is poured out for you is the New Covenant in my blood.” (Lk 22:19-20;
CCC 1365)
The Altar
The altar is a symbol of Christ himself. It is at once the “altar of
sacrifice” where Christ is offered to the Father, and the “table of the
Lord,” where the assemblies of the faithful come to be reconciled to the Lord
and to receive him as “food” from heaven. The Eucharistic liturgy expresses
the inseparable connection between the sacrifice of Christ and the communion of
the faithful with Christ. (cf. CCC 1383)</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p25">
          <p>The Word
Finally, God’s word is celebrated in the Liturgy of the Word at Mass. The
readings are taken from “the book of the Word,” the lectionary (cf. CCC 1154),
first from Old Testament prophets, followed by the Letters of the Apostles and
finally the Gospels of the four evangelists. These readings are generally
grouped according to cycles of three years. The homily comes next. It should be
an inspiring application of the readings to the spiritual and moral needs of the
particular assembly. On Sundays and other great feast days, the assembly then
makes a public profession of faith by reciting the Nicene Creed. The Prayer of
the Faithful, General Intercessions, conclude the Liturgy of the Word. These are
“supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings … made for all …”

<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2725 **** -->1. Among the 19,000 Catholic parishes in the United States listed in the
Official Catholic Directory, all parishes have at least some members involved in
their activities. Common roles for the laity include: the parish council,
greeters and ushers at the Sunday Masses, lectors and extraordinary ministers of
Holy Communion, teachers in the parish school, religious education instructors,
RCIA, food pantry, St. Vincent de Paul Society, liturgy team, youth group, bible
study groups, prayer groups, and CLCC Small Eccclesial Faith
Communities. Working with the priest, dedicated lay men and women and young
adults carry out these activities. They are persons of faith, prayer, blessed
with good will and the desire to serve God, his Church and the community.</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p27">
          <p>2. However active the laity may be in parish ministries, often through no fault
of their own, they hunger for deeper spirituality and catechesis. This means
they need better knowledge of the faith, the meaning of the Creed, the need of
the Sacraments and the necessity of Prayer. Often they lack understanding of the
mystery of the Church, the Body of Christ and its structure. Many concede they
lack basic familiarity with Sacred Scripture, thus the growing interest in bible
study. The Catechism of the Catholic Church, though known to them, seems
overwhelming (a book of 904 pages), yet it is the official and orthodox source
of truth about Jesus, his teachings and his Church.
3. Learning and being able to talk to others confidently about God and his Son,
Jesus, is not just nice or useful but essential for living life as a Catholic
Christian. In the Catechism we read: “The Old Testament attests that God is the
source of all truth. His Word [Jesus] is truth. His law is truth. Since God is
’true,’ the members of his people are called to live in the truth.” (CCC 2465)

Jesus is to live in “the Spirit of truth.” Jesus who was sent by the Father

of Christ. In brief, they “are consecrated to be a spiritual house and a holy
priesthood.” By this consecration they become the “living stones … built
into a spiritual house of God to be a holy priesthood to offer spiritual
sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.” (1 Pet 2:5; cf. CCC 784)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p34">
          <p>3. “Hence the laity, dedicated as they are to Christ and anointed by the Holy
Spirit, are marvelously called and prepared” to produce “even richer fruits of
the Spirit.” “For all their works, prayers and apostolic undertakings, family
and married life, daily work, relaxation of mind and body, if they are
accomplished in the Holy Spirit-indeed even the hardships of life if patiently
borne-all these become spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus
Christ. In the celebration of the Eucharist these may most fittingly be offered
to the Father along with the body of the Lord. And so, worshiping everywhere by
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2800 **** -->their holy actions, the laity consecrates the world itself to God, everywhere
offering worship by the holiness of their lives.” (CCC 901)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p35">
          <p>E. We are a Prophetic People
1. This term, prophetic, may suggest that baptized Catholics are like weather
forecasters who predict climate changes, but who preach doctrinal and
disciplinary truths of the Church. The term, however, has a very specific
meaning. At their baptism Christians receive the gift and role of being
spokespersons of God in ways proper to them. They are called by God to make his
Son known to others by sharing the good news about Jesus and his works, making
this sharing a part of the mission of their lives.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p36">
          <p>2. The term “prophetic” comes from the original notion of prophets in the Old
Testament. These men were special messengers chosen and gifted by God. He
inspired them with his word, and by the power of the Holy Spirit impelled them
to proclaim the Lord’s word, sometimes under extreme suffering, to the people in
various periods of time prior to Jesus’ coming on earth.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p37">
          <p>3. John the Baptizer, a relative of Jesus, was the last of the great Old
Testament prophets. (cf. Mk 11:32; Lk 20:6; CCC 523,719) He preached a baptism
of repentance (Mt 3:2) and announced the coming of the Messiah. (CCC 522, 555,
702) Of Jesus, John said, “the one who is coming after me is mightier than I.”
(Mt 3:11).</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p38">
          <p>4. Jesus was the last and the “greatest of prophets.” (cf. Mt 12:41ff; Lk
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2825 **** -->11:31ff) As such he was recognized by the Samaritan woman at the well, “Sir, I
see you are a prophet.” (Jn 4:19) On entering Jerusalem triumphantly the crowd
exclaimed, “This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee.” (Mt 21:11)
When the blind man began to see, the Pharisees questioned him who gave him his
sight. Referring to Jesus, he said, “He is a prophet.” (Jn 9:17; also cf. Lk
1:67-76)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p39">
          <p>5. Inseparable from the role of prophet is the office of teacher. The four
gospel writers record numerous episodes where the disciples and people of Jesus’
day addressed Jesus as teacher or master. And rightly so! They saw and heard
Jesus teach the crowds the truths of God with authority on the mountain, in the
desert, in villages, in the synagogue, at the seashore, in people’s private
homes, and in his 7 last words on the Cross. (cf. Mt 23:10; Mk 10:17; Lk 20:21;
cf. CCC 2605)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p40">
          <p>6. The “Sacred Deposit” of the faith consists of Sacred Scripture and
Tradition. It is the collection of teachings of the Apostles entrusted to the
Church’s pastors for transmission to the faithful. (cf. CCC 84) Authentic
interpretation of the Word of God is entrusted to the living, teaching office of
the Church alone, the magisterium. (cf. CCC 86) “This means that the task of
interpretation has been entrusted to the bishops in communion with the successor
of Peter, the Bishop of Rome.” (CCC 85)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p41">
          <p>7. Keeping in mind the above material for background, we come now to see how the
laity participates in the prophetic office of Christ. “Christ … fulfills this
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2850 **** -->prophetic office, not only by the hierarchy … but also by the laity. He
accordingly both establishes them as witnesses and provides them with the sense
of faith (sensus fidei) and the grace of the word.” The great St. Thomas
Aquinas wrote, “To teach in order to lead others to faith is the task of every
preacher and of each believer.” (cf. CCC 904)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p42">
          <p>8. Thus, lay people fulfill their prophetic mission by evangelization, “that
is, the proclamation of Christ by word and testimony of life.” For lay people,
“this evangelization … acquires a specific property and peculiar efficacy
because it is accomplished in the ordinary circumstances of the world.” Witness
of life, however, is not the sole element in the apostolate; the true apostle is
on the lookout for occasions of announcing Christ by word, either to unbelievers
… or to the faithful. (CCC 905) Lay people who are capable and trained may
also collaborate in catechetical formation, in teaching the sacred sciences, and
in the use of the communications media. (CCC 906)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p43">
          <p>9. All the holy People of God, therefore, have a share in Christ’s prophetic
office, “above all in the super-natural sense of faith that belongs to the
whole People, lay and clergy, when it ’unfailingly adheres to this faith
… once for all delivered to the saints,’ and when it deepens its understanding
and becomes Christ’s witness in the midst of the world.” (CCC 785)
In view of the several authoritative Church teachings quoted here, one could
imagine that the Council Fathers of Vatican II and the authors of the Catechism
of the Catholic Church envisioned a process like Celebrating Life as a Catholic
Christian, whose aim and purpose is to form baptized Catholics more deeply in
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2875 **** -->the faith, and with the help of God’s grace influence lapsed Catholics to return
to the Church. This process was produced and is promoted by the National
Catholic Conference for Total Stewardship.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p44">
          <p>F. We are a Royal People
1. The last office, which Christ shares with us, is his royal (kingly)
office. How did Jesus come to royalty? Was he not a humble carpenter in
Nazareth? When Nathaniel who later was named Bartholomew was invited by Andrew
to meet Jesus, he commented jokingly “can anything good come out of Nazareth?”
(Jn 1:46) Later when Jesus met Nathaniel knowing of his comment, he complemented
him his good-natured humor, “Here is a true Israelite. There is no duplicity in
him.” (Jn 1:47)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p45">
          <p>2. Slowly Jesus’ “royalty,” really his divinity, began to surface. When he
taught in the synagogue in his hometown, Nazareth, his own people were
astonished at his wisdom and the “mighty deeds he wrought by his hands.” They
said, “where did he get all this?” “Is he not the carpenter, the son of
Mary?” “And they took offense at him.” (cf. Mk 6:2-3)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p46">
          <p>3. Authority is almost always part and parcel of royalty. The following are
sample texts affirming Jesus’ royal authority. Speaking on the importance of
building one’s house on rock rather than sand, the crowds were astonished, “for
he taught as one having authority, and not as their scribes.” (Mt 7:29) When
Jesus healed the paralytic in Capernaum and forgave his sins, the scribes were
discussing by what authority he was doing these things? Jesus knowing their
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2900 **** -->thoughts said, “But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority to
forgives sins on earth-he said to the paralytic, I say to you, rise, pick up
your mat, and go home.” (Mk 2:6-11; also cf. 11:28)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p47">
          <p>In his prayer at the Last Supper, Jesus attests to his universal
authority. “Father, the hour has come. Give glory to your son, so that your son
may glorify you, just as you gave him authority over all people, so that he may
give eternal life to all you gave him.” (Jn 17:1-2) These sample texts are
clearly royal in tone and content.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p48">
          <p>4. To share in Christ’s kingly office is an amazing gift, which he gave us at
baptism. How do we know we share in Jesus’ role as king? By his death and
resurrection Jesus draws all men to himself. In baptism we die with Christ and
rise with Christ; we die to sin and death and rise to holiness and eternal
life. Doing this Jesus “made himself the servant of all, for he came ’not to be
served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”’ (Mt 20:28) In
this way Christ exercises his royal prerogative. He chose to be a servant
king. By this fact He is King and Lord of the universe. (cf. CCC 786)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p49">
          <p>5. We Christians share in Christ’s kingship when we “serve him” especially
when we recognize him “in the poor and suffering” and see in them the poor and
suffering Redeemer King. “To reign is to serve him.” (LG 8) In this way the
People of God fulfills its royal dignity by living their vocation, which is “to
serve Christ.” (CCC 786)</p>

        <!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2925 **** -->
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p50">
          <p>6. Exercising a kingly role
How can the laity exercise their kingly role in the CLCC process? Start with
fundamentals.
a. Overcome “the reign of sin” in yourself
Do this by controlling your passions and allurement to evil and strive to live a
holy life. (cf. CCC 908)
b. Join forces with other like-minded lay persons
Christians should “remedy institutions and conditions of the world [which] are
an inducement to sin,” examples: media, books, education, malls, lewd and
pornographic TV shows and immoral Internet videos. Parents, grandparents,
baby-sitters, daycare attendants have a serious responsibility to monitor
children’s consumption of TV, Internet, video games, electronic messaging,
smartphones and other popular media.
c. Impregnate culture and human works with a moral value
Combat the social suicide of artificial contraception, abortion, partial birth
abortion (consider our aging population), Internet pornography, rampant egoism,
individualism, divorce, re-marriage, cohabitation, abused and neglected
children, the active homosexual lifestyle, dishonesty, selfishness, perversion
of the judicial system, justice, murder, suicide, drugs. These undeniable
realities not only are hindering the practice of virtue but are destructive of
the fabric of a healthy society and its culture. As a kingly people Christians
must penetrate the culture and inculcate moral values. (cf. CCC 909)
d. Cooperate with pastors
“The laity can feel called, or in fact be called (example, to become a Matrix
member or join a Small Ecclesial Faith Community) to cooperate with their
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2950 **** -->pastors in the service of the ecclesial community, for the sake of its growth
and life” (the CLCC process) “This can be done through the exercise of
different kinds of ministries according to the grace and charisms which the Lord
has been pleased to bestow on them.” (cf. CCC 910)
e. Distinguish one’s Christian duties carefully
Christ’s kingly people should “distinguish carefully between the rights and
duties which they have as belonging to the Church, and those which fall to them
as members of the human society.” For example Catholic politicians who say they
are pro-life but vote pro-choice explaining they cannot “impose” their
morality on others. This is a position which is contradictory and therefore
untenable. Although they try they cannot reconcile the contradiction. “They are
to be guided by a Christian conscience, since no human activity, even of the
temporal order, (e.g. abortion) can be withdrawn from God’s dominion.” (CCC
912)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p51">
          <p>f. Serve as witnesses and instruments
“Thus, every person, through these gifts given to him (priestly, prophetic and
kingly offices), is at once the witness and the living instrument of the mission
of the Church itself ‘according to the measure of Christ’s bestowal.”’ (CCC 913)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p52">
          <p>G. Emphasize the laity’s “rights and duties” in
the Church’s mission
1. All that has been said thus far in Stage 3 centers on the Lord’s outpouring
of his gifts to his people. Therefore, because gifts have been received
obligations follow. They are: to be acknowledged with gratitude, managed and
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 2975 **** -->used responsibly. And as receivers of the gifts we should be acutely aware that
as a priestly, prophetic and kingly people we have a “right and duty” to
practice good stewardship in our families and in the mission of the Church.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p53">
          <p>2. The many quotations cited above from the Dogmatic Constitution of the Church
and the Catechism of the Catholic Church attest mightily that the laity have
“rights and duties” to participate in the life of Christ and in its vast
mission of evangelization. One area of the Church’s apostolic mission, which may
not be swept under the rug because of commitment to other ministries, is the
shocking estimated 47 million U.S. Catholics who do not go to Mass
regularly. This reality suffers no delay to correct.
3. The National Catholic Conference for Total Stewardship feels its work is cut
out for it: to initiate in all parishes this formation and conversion process,
Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian (CLCC), for the up building and
re-building of the kingdom of God on earth. It forms God’s people more deeply in
the faith and equips them to reach out to lapsed and wayward Catholics with the
hope of bringing their brothers and sisters back into the arms of Mother Church
through Jesus, the Redeemer.</p>

          <p>The format is simple:</p>

          <p>What Jesus did in Galilee
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3000 **** -->He went to villages to proclaim the Good News first to his own people, the Jews.
Enacting in the parish what Jesus did in Galilee
The pastor preaches the good news of the CLCC process to his people at the
Sunday Masses. He recommends Lay Leaders, the Matrix 12, helps them organize
into a Small Ecclesial Faith Community, and they begin holding their weekly
spiritual formation sessions. Their job is also to begin establishing other
Small Ecclesial Faith Communities, showing parishioners who join them how to
hold their weekly spiritual formation sessions.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p57">
          <p>H. The Indispensability of Preaching
1. Spiritual formation is really catechesis, and in the CLCC process it’s done
in two ways. The first is by “preached catechesis.” This means hearing and
learning about the CLCC process through the proclaimed word in Sunday
homilies. Preached catechesis also means “getting a feeling” of the CLCC
process from not one but many explanations given by the preachers, thus
impacting the people with the “feeling.” The second way is by “shared
catechesis.” This means giving and receiving spiritual formation within the
formation sessions conducted in the Small Ecclesial Faith Communities (SEFC).
2. Preaching the CLCC is vital in all 5 Stages of the process for achieving the
intended results. Fatal to the process is if the priest feels that one talk on
the process will do the job. It won’t. It can’t. The process is big and
ongoing. The priest needs to explain aspects of the process to his people, to
show his full support of the process, his encouragement to those involved and
his urging to those not yet involved. By showing his own involvement in the
process, though limited, he shows he wants and is pushing this spiritual
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3025 **** -->formation and conversion process one hundred percent. This assures his people he
wants the intended results to be attained, and knowing this the people will
respond.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p58">
          <p>3. Priests and deacons are kindly asked to preach the material as given in each
of the 5 Stages. Most recommended is that a single paragraph or passage,
quotation or text be selected and expanded upon, keeping in mind always to
instill clearer and deeper understanding of a particular aspect of the formation
process. One cannot say it all in one talk. Nor can we expect the people to
understand the meaning and purpose of the whole process in one talk, nor to
digest a plate full of explanation when a morsel will satisfy.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p59">
          <p>4. Ongoing preaching does not mean preaching on the CLCC every week but
frequently with prudent spacing. The rationale? The people need repeatedly to be
informed, motivated, supported and encouraged: the Matrix 12, all parishioners
in SEFCs and those not yet participating. After the five stages in Part I have
been preached, and all five stages carried out in weekly spiritual formation
sessions, then material in Part II is begun. Again it is shared within
SEFCs. Priests and deacons preach, as prudence dictates, the topics as given in
Part II. Some preachers may prefer to go directly to the primary sources to
select passages other than those given in Part II in support of their message;
this is commendable. But please stay on track of the CLCC process.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p60">
          <p>I. Preview of Part II, More Gifts
1. The documents listed in Part II, like those in Part I, are invaluable gifts
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3050 **** -->by which Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, pontiffs of towering stature,
have enriched the Church. These “gifts” are encyclicals, apostolic
exhortations and apostolic letters that have immediate relevance for the
faithful in the present age. These documents have the weight of official
teachings of the Church’s magisterium. The list also includes an Instruction on
“Authentic Liturgy” and a Declaration “On the Unicity and Salvific
Universality of Jesus Christ and the Church.” These are pronouncements authored
and signed by high-level Vatican officials and approved by the Pope.
Sad to say most Catholics know nothing about these high-charged teachings. Many
have not even heard of them. This situation is not entirely their fault. They
have not been informed about them, nor has anyone told them of their usefulness
for updating their knowledge of Catholic doctrine, their need for formation of a
right conscience, for strengthening marriage and family life, for preparation
for various apostolates such as reshaping culture with Christian values, and for
personal and communal spiritual growth for Celebrating Life as Catholic
Christians.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.Sx1.p61">
          <p>Thus, the documents in Part II present a welcome and urgent catechesis for
weekly formation sessions in the parish, for CLCC leaders, for the people who
already belong to one of the Small Ecclesial Faith Communities, and for people
in the parish still undecided whether to upgrade their knowledge of the faith
and spiritual life due to various personal circumstances.</p>

          <p>Introduction
1. The issues stated in this paragraph center on the elements proper to the
concept of stewardship. Though generally known they deserve repeating for
reflection because they are recorded in various ways throughout God’s revealed
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3125 **** -->word. The elements are: “recognition” of gifts received, “dominion” (loaned
not owned), “manage them wisely,” “use them in a manner pleasing to God,”
“acknowledge God who is the Supreme Giver,” “give him humble, daily thanks.”
Ask yourself, do I do these things consciously and prayerfully?</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.S1.p4">
          <p>2. Stewardship of our gifts! Reflect on the “every day gifts” you enjoy, and
the gifts that are personal to you. Spiritual formation based on the gift of
faith means that we acknowledge God as the “chief agent of all gifts,” that
out of his love and wisdom, God distributes to each person gifts special to him
or her for the present life and that lead to one’s ultimate life in
eternity. Think how great and good God is to you!</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.S1.p5">
          <p>3. Pre-eminent! Of God’s many and varied gifts, pre-eminent are the supernatural
gifts of faith, hope and charity. Faith is the foundational gift, which makes
the practice of religion possible. Reflect: what a miserable person I would be
without the strength of my faith especially in times of stress and
trial. “Lord, help my unbelief.” (cf. Mk 9:24)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.S1.p6">
          <p>4. God is good and generous. Here we come to the great mystery of God’s
gratuitous giving. What does this mean? It means that God gives us his gifts
freely, and we receive them without deserving them, meriting or earning
them. Example: We may say, “I got this gratis,” meaning you received a favor
without the giver expecting a return, payment or recompense. In no way can we
recompense God except by giving him humble and prayerful thanks and
praise. Giving God prayerful thanks daily is a key component of
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3150 **** -->stewardship. Reflect and share.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.S1.p7">
          <p>5. Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian means practicing responsible
stewardship of the innumerable gifts we receive from God daily and through our
lifetime. These gifts include no less than the divinely revealed word of God,
the Holy Bible. It is composed of three inter-connected elements: evangelization
(the good news), discipleship (becoming a faithful follower of Christ) and
serving one’s neighbor by sharing one’s various gifts and resources with him
(service). The sum of these linked elements is called Total Stewardship. To
become a good steward of all of one’s gifts is to Celebrate Life as a Catholic
Christian.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch9.S1.p8">

right and wrong and helped to form a “right conscience.” This obliges him to
seek out the truth. When he or she is informed of the truth, which is situated

we accept the most extreme forms of “diversity,” e.g. so-called same-sex

<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3225 **** -->follow. An erroneous conscience is one that is in error. A person has an
erroneous conscience, when he commits sin:
In willful ignorance, that is, when he deliberately ignores, neglects or rejects
information about the rightness or wrongness of his action. This is called
culpable or blameworthy ignorance. His conscience is in error and he incurs the
guilt of sin.
The other “error” of conscience occurs when a person commits sin in ignorance
which is not deliberate, non-intentional. This is called invincible or no-fault
ignorance. Though not guilty of sin, he is responsible to learn the truth about
his action.

Liberties Union (ACLU), claiming the monument violated separation of church and
state. Was this decision a violation of the right of “free exercise” of

meanings. Example: kitchen, a single object which has many unexpressed meanings:

being a forecaster (e.g. of weather) or a predictor of the outcome of an event
(e.g. winner of a Super Bowl game). To be prophetic means to be a spokesperson
of God, making his Son Jesus known and accepting this role as one’s mission. The
Old Testament had a long line of prophets. They were called, chosen, and made
inspired messengers of God. Some didn’t want the job, even resisted it, felt

loving, honest and truthful. Right? The Catechism of the Catholic Church states
“Parents are the principal and first educators of their children.” (CCC 1635)
Vatican Council II states, parents “by word and example [are] the first heralds
of the faith with regard to their children. They should encourage them in the
vocation which is proper to each child, fostering with special care any
religious vocation.” (cf. LG 11; also cf. CCC 2225-2226)
Whether you are a grandparent, parent, single or young adult, or teenager in
your SEFC you are a teacher. Reflect: each time you share the truth, you are
God’s messenger. When you share in your SEFC, you are a “teacher.” Let your

things are given to us: our sins are forgiven, grace is given for growing in
holiness, and we receive the status of adopted children of God. We become heirs
of his heavenly kingdom. Only Christ could by his divine and kingly power united
with his Father and the Holy Spirit rise from the dead. Joined as we are to
Christ he will raise us from the dead on the last day. In this way Christ makes
himself a servant to us. He is a servant king, “a ransom for many.” By dying
and rising with Christ in baptism we are given a share in his royal
servanthood. Your servanthood is expressed when you render service to your

1. This paragraph reawakens awareness that as God’s People we are privileged

gifts received demand giving thanks to the Father who gave them. Attached to
one’s gifts are “rights and duties.” “Rights” give us freedom to use them
according to God’s plan. “Duties” impose the obligation to use them
productively for personal good and the good of others. “Duties” include

<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3475 **** -->an enthusiastic, interesting overview. Homilies should say what the process
gives parishioners, namely ongoing systematic formation in doctrine and
spirituality in weekly 90 minute sessions. Later homilies should explain how
spiritual formation is conjoined to planned, methodical outreach to lapsed
Catholics to help them return to the faith.
This is followed with particulars: that the process is lay-led by a core group
called the Matrix 12, that participation of all parishioners is the goal, and
that participation takes place in SEFCs. Homilies should focus strongly on the
establishment of Small Ecclesial Faith Communities throughout the parish, what
they are and why are they “ecclesial.” Each stage has an abundance of material
for preached catechesis that is nearly inexhaustible.
Reflect: how can I help, encourage, pray and respectfully prod the priest to
preach the process to make it “bear much fruit” for all parishioners? Pray and

God, your sanctification.” (1 Thes 4:3; cf. Eph 1:4) Holiness, sanctification,
is not for a few but for all. The Apostles Creed, the prayer at the beginning of
the rosary, expresses this well and succinctly. “I believe in the holy catholic
Church, the communion of Saints.”</p>

4. A tendency in Church ministry, it seems, though there are noteworthy
exceptions, is that the “saved” are pre-occupied with “saving the saved.”
The “saved” are Catholics who attend Mass regularly and drop in their
envelope, but beyond weekly Sunday Mass are uninvolved in any parish life. It
seems they choose rather to stand on the sidelines and not be on the playing
field of parish activities. It can be said on the other hand that the
“non-saved” are lapsed, non-church going Catholics, many of whom are not even
faintly aware of the precarious spiritual condition they are in. Are the
“saved” in many parishes not giving the “non-saved” the urgent attention
they need for their salvation?</p>

educated in Catholic elementary and secondary schools, and not a few have
attended Catholic colleges, who come to Mass only at Christmas, Easter or attend
a funeral or wedding of a relative or friend during the year.</p>

          <p>What is meant by the expression “the saved saving the saved?”
6. It means that church-going men, women, youth and children are given greater
religious and spiritual services by the parish than are given to lapsed,
non-church going Catholics. This does not imply that the lapsed are wholly
ignored. Not at all! It does mean that woefully insufficient attention is given
to helping the lapsed return to the Church. Celebrating Life as a Catholic
Christian (CLCC) is a results-producing process of systematic spiritual
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3550 **** -->formation which equips and motivates the “saved” to reach out to the loosely
called “non-saved,” lapsed, non-church going Catholics, including alienated,
indifferent and marginal Catholics. It reaches out to Catholics “on the edge”
and to those who are outside the Church for whatever reason, and helps them
return to it.
Pope John Paul II’s New Evangelization means precisely this: to awaken a
missionary spirit among the People of God to go out to those who need to hear
the truth of faith and be formed in it and by it.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p9">
          <p>7. In the United States 19,000 Catholic parishes are spread over 196 Catholic
dioceses. Surveys show that about 1 out of 4 baptized Catholics go to Mass
regularly, or about 25%. What about the 75% who do not go to Mass regularly or
not at all? The high percentage of non-church-goers would be lowered
significantly if, a) non-church going Catholics living within the boundaries of
a parish were sought out, and b) if they were brought into Small Ecclesial Faith
Communities, re-introduced gradually into the faith–the aim being to help them
make a decision to return to the faith–returnees over time would be so
overwhelming that Catholic churches would not be able to hold them all.
The CLCC process is not keeping a scorecard or looking at numbers. The
missionary aim of the CLCC process is winning former church members back to the
faith. The heart of the Church’s mission and the heart of the CLCC mission are
one and the same, to have a passionate desire to bring Christ’s salvation to
all.</p>

          <p>8. Many Catholic parishes throughout this country already have outreach programs
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3575 **** -->in place such as “Come Home,” “Come Home for Christmas,” and others. For
years the Legion of Mary has been in the forefront of this apostolate. The RCIA
is doing a formidable job in giving growth to the Church each year. The CLCC,
however, is a process not a program that unfolds over five stages. It has a
beginning but no end. It is ongoing due to the kind of apostolic ministry it
is. Great results take place over time, not in a couple of semesters or seasons
or a year.
The CLCC process forms people to conform to Christ in order to reform their
lives and come to full communion with Christ in holiness in his Church, the
Mystical Body. The crowning goal of the CLCC process is to help all the Lay
Faithful of Christ become saints. This requires pastoral planning, perseverance
and God’s grace working uniquely in each person over time.</p>

          <p>Work Cut Out
1. Recall that the CLCC process in all of its 5 Stages runs in perfect parallel
with Jesus’ public ministry. What Jesus did in Galilee in five stages, the CLCC
process does in five stages in the parish. In Stage 4 Jesus reached out to
non-Jews, to Samaritans, Gentiles, Romans and others to bring them the good
news. (cf. Centerfold, page 144) In Stage 4 the CLCC process reaches out to
non-practicing Catholics in the parish to bring them the good news and an
invitation to conversion.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p12">
          <p>2. Following are three biblical episodes, really classic models of the CLCC
process. Each of the three models demonstrates a particular element of the
process.
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3600 **** -->The first model is the Parable of the Lost Sheep (Lk 15:4-7), searching and
finding the lost. Jesus asks, “What man among you having a hundred sheep and
losing one of them would not leave the ninety-nine and go after the lost one
until he finds it?” (4)
The second model is the Parable of the Prodigal Son (Lk 15:11-32), the lost has
been found. The father rejoices and calls a celebration. “This son of mine was
dead, and has come to life again; he was lost, and has been found.” (24)
The third model is the Conversion of the Samaritan Women at the Well (Jn
4:4-42), her formation and evangelization. After her person-to-person
conversion in the one-Person Small Faith Community of Jesus and herself, she
went with heart burning with zeal to tell the good news about Jesus to her town
people of Shechem. (verses 29-30,39)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p13">
          <p>3. At the parish level spiritually formed parishioners in Small Ecclesial Faith
Communities begin to evangelize. They go out to non-practicing, non-church going
Catholics scattered throughout the parish. They visit them in their homes,
invite them to join a Small Ecclesial Faith Community for formation in the
faith, and in prayer help them to begin considering returning to the Church. In
this way koinonia, building up “communion” within the Church takes
place. Reclaiming lapsed and negligent Catholics is a prime way of bringing
Christ’s Church to “full stature.” (Eph 4:13)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p14">
          <p>A. Home Visitors
1. Home visitors are faithful Catholics who strive to live the truths of faith
intelligently and conscientiously, and out of love for Christ want to spread the
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3625 **** -->same truth and love to others. They are Catholics who reach a point in their
spiritual formation when they want to do ministry of substance. They are ready
for a challenge and want to produce results. Finding lapsed Catholics within a
parish, visiting them in their homes, selling them on entering a non-threatening
Small Ecclesial Faith Community for formation, and getting them to open up to
the graces of the Holy Spirit for reentry into the Church is indeed a ministry
of substance. This was Jesus’ ministry. He visited people in their towns,
villages and homes, and taught groups on mountainsides and lakeshores. He told
them about his new way of life. His purpose was to win them for his
kingdom. Home visitors have an identical ministry.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p15">
          <p>2. To be successful home visitors, leaders and members of SEFCs need on-going
spiritual formation to keep growing in the faith and keep their commitment at
high level to evangelize lapsed Catholics. Never should they yield to the
temptation to think they have arrived, know all that is needed to know, and that
their own formation is complete. This is to deceive oneself. The agent of
deception never rests. Because the Lord has blessed us with “many and varied
gifts” (cf. Stage 3), we have an obligation to use them responsibly for
building up his kingdom on earth and for giving him the glory he is due. For
best results, formation in SEFCs is non-stop. Newcomers to a SEFC depend on the
seasoned members for guidance, example and inspiration for their
conversion. Rookie returnees should never feel they were let down by the
veterans in their search for Christ.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p16">
          <p>3. Contacting, visiting and befriending lapsed, non-church going Catholics is
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3650 **** -->one thing. Another thing is that a lapsed Catholic may feel the visit is an
intrusion on his or her privacy and resist the idea of coming into a SEFC in the
parish. Pray and persevere. Do not stop the visits. Practice patience; have
confidence! Your zeal and charity are your leverage. A change of heart will come
even in the “hardest cases.” One day, perhaps after the third or fourth
friendly visit, the person will come around and tell his or her story. Listening
to the person’s story whether told in the home or later in a SEFC, but always
with attention and compassion, is the first step in the conversion process. The
newcomer to a SEFC must feel welcome, loved and made comfortable in the
group. Present at his first group session the newcomer will immediately see how
a faith formation session is conducted in a SEFC. He or she must be encouraged
to participate.
More important than anything else, the newcomer will observe the joyful
seriousness of the members. He will observe the dignity of the group, its
prayerfulness and un-pretended commitment to its apostolate. Seeing these
inspiring qualities will impact the lapsed person. Spiritual formation after his
long abandoned faith will seem less alien and less difficult to
regain. Gradually the person will feel he belongs to the group. In this
environment of Christian love, the power of the Holy Spirit will “touch” his
heart nudging him to return to the faith for re-entry into the Church, and
reunion with Christ.
4. To make return to the Church permanent and solid, returnees need on-going
formation in the faith. Where and how? By belonging to a Small Ecclesial Faith
Community! Remaining in it the returnee experiences how the faith is practiced
on a deeper level. He will receive correct answers to continuing questions he
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3675 **** -->may have about the faith. He experiences the wondrous power of group prayer,
bonding with like-minded friends for trust, support, strength and help. In the
SEFC he begins to get a “sense” of the mystery of “communion,” koinonia,
within the Church, and how this divine glue makes the Church Universal “One and
Holy.” “Communion” within the Church also means the loving interaction of the
People of God in grace who are concerned about the salvation of one another and
who strive to help each other on the uphill journey to eternal life.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p17">
          <p>5. Essential also for the returnee is the good example and lifestyle of
practicing Catholics. These are Catholics who attend Sunday Mass regularly,
participate devoutly in the liturgies, receive the sacrament of penance and
reconciliation frequently, and receive Holy Communion in a manner that shows
they know what they are doing. They are also Catholics who live by the 10
Commandments, obey the moral law of God, have children according to the plan of
God, and who raise and educate their children in the Catholic faith, some at
great sacrificial cost. They train them to be responsible stewards of their
gifts, to be honest, just and respectful of all people, to be patriotic and
productive American citizens and abide by the Constitution of the United
States. Lastly they pray and inculcate the habit of family and private prayer in
their children.
These are some of the great treasures that the Church has, practices and enjoys
for increasing love of God and neighbor in people’s hearts. Home Visitors yearn
to share them with Catholics in need of returning to the Church. They sustain
conversion to Christ in everyone. They are fundamental requirements for
Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian.

        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p18">
          <p>B. Home Visitors are Evangelizers
1. Jesus’ strongest and most explicit mandate to his Apostles immediately prior
to his Ascension into heaven was to evangelize. “Go, therefore, and make
disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded
you. And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age.” (Mt 28:19-20)
These solemn words of Jesus make evangelization the priority of the Church, the
diocese and the parish to “end of the age.”</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p19">
          <p>2. The above text deserves long and deep reflection. Why? Because it pertains
not only to the apostles, but also to home visitors in our day and to all
followers of Christ of every age! Therefore, clergy and laity have a solemn duty
to evangelize, to proclaim the good news to those present to them and willing to
hear it. This duty also extends without exception to those far removed from
them, unknown to them, indifferent to hearing the word, and perhaps deliberately
resisting it. The latter group for the most part are lapsed, non-church going,
alienated Catholics.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p20">
          <p>3. Lay Catholics, called home visitors, have an obligation to go out to them,
find them and visit them. Because this obligation is serious, it is not a choice
to discuss: “should we go,” “can we go,” “will we go?” Lapsed Catholics
are an ailing part of the People of God. They are in critical need of
salvation. They need to be contacted, and with utmost discretion and
sensitivity, urged to return to communion with the Church. They need to be
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3725 **** -->brought into an environment which will help them return to Christ. In Stage 4 of
the CLCC process, home visitation is a “duty” incumbent on Catholic men and
women in Small Ecclesial Faith Communities to help estranged Catholics re-unite
with Christ in his Church.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p21">
          <p>4. Regarding conversion of sinners, St. James offers this appealing incentive to
persons who are diffident or fearful about making home visits: “My brothers, if
anyone among you should stray from the truth and someone bring him back, he
should know that whoever brings back a sinner from the error of his way will
save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.” (cf. Jas 5:19-20)</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p22">
          <p>5. Home visitors reach out to non-church going Catholics and help them with the
power of God’s grace return to the faith. This is no small challenge but worth
every effort. Pope John Paul II addresses this challenge from the cultural
perspective. He said in sum, that Catholics like other persons are not immune to
powerful, cultural, neo-pagan influences that undermine not only Christian
values but also the values of humanity itself.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p23">
          <p>6. Quoting Vatican Council II’s document, Gaudium et Spes, GS, the Pastoral
Constitution of the Church in the Modern World, the Holy Father deplores “the
development of a culture [which] becomes dissociated not only from Christian
faith, but even from human values.” (GS 58) John Paul II also quotes Pope Paul
VI’s apostolic exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi, Evangelization in the Modern
World, EN, “What matters is to evangelize humanity’s culture and the cultures
of human families … The split between the Gospel and culture is without a
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3750 **** -->doubt the drama of our time, just as it was of other times. Therefore, every
effort must be made to ensure full evangelization of culture, or more correctly
cultures.” (EN 18-19) It seems clear that a major factor contributing to the
great falling away from the Church is due to the cultures in which we live.</p>

          <p>7. Parishioners in Small Ecclesial Faith Communities do two things: they join a
Small Ecclesial Faith Community, akoinonia, to grow personally and with others
in their spiritual life, and to become home visitors, representatives of their
parish, to lapsed, non-church going Catholics living within the parish. As a
member of a SEFC they assume the duty to evangelize, a duty of highest
importance. Pope Paul VI in Evangelii Nuntiandi stated emphatically that
“person-to-person” contact is “indispensable” for the transmission of the
gospel. (cf. EN 46) Thus, what better way to evangelize a lapsed,
non-church-going Catholic than by making friendly contact with the person in his
home?</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p25">
          <p>8. Paul VI goes on to say, that “side by side with the collective proclamation
[that is, the Liturgy of the Word with homily on Sunday], the other form of
transmission [is] person-to person.” He asks, “is there any other way of
handing on the gospel than by transmitting to another person one’s personal
experience of faith?” He answers his own question. “It must not happen that
the pressing need to proclaim the Good News to the multitudes should cause us to
forget this form of proclamation whereby an individual’s conscience is reached
and touched [emphasis added] by receiv[ing] [it] from someone else.” (EN 46)</p>

          <p>9. Formation of home visitors for evangelization is necessary and
imperative. Reaching perfection in holiness that God has in his plan for them is
not fully attained on earth, but in heaven. While on earth formation in the
spiritual life is an on-going growth process. We may never say without danger of
blasphemy, “I’ve arrived, I’m there,” “I am holy.” Lay leaders of the Matrix
12 and the groups of 8 to 12 persons who make up SEFCs in the parish must
recognize this fundamental reality of spiritual formation. Advancing in
knowledge and love of Christ and his Church cannot be measured on an imaginary
barometer that has a top level marked, “HOLY.” What characterizes Stage 4 is,
it centers on and provides systematic spiritual formation to SEFC
participants. It fills them with the gift of grace to want to reach out and
evangelize lapsed Catholics by visiting them in their homes as Jesus did.</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p27">
          <p>10. The “catechesis” given in Parts I and II of this manual is in fact a
catechesis specifically for formation of parishioners in SEFCs. It is a
wholesome experience for them to hear, accept and discuss the words of Christ
and his Church, planting them deeply in their minds and hearts and turning these
great truths they into convictions to live by. The first source of these truths
is the Bible, the divinely inspired writings handed down by the apostles to us
through the Church. The second source is the rich and profound body of
magisterial and papal pronouncements. These are Vatican Council II
Constitutions, Decrees and Declarations, papal encyclicals, apostolic
exhortations, pastoral letters, instructions and various clarifications issued
by the Vatican.</p>

          <p>11. We are living in an age of cultural decline. The essentially religious
culture by which our nation thrived for two hundred years is being
systematically de-Christianized by the powerful forces of atheism, secularism,
materialism and relativism. Greed, power seeking and self-interest are diseases
that undermine the culture. Influenced by leftist higher education, the media,
TV, a greatly corrupted legal system, cruel disregard for the sacredness of
human life and living in a radical humanistic environment, it becomes
understandable how Catholics can fall from the faith and communion with the
Church, and from each other.
The culture in which we live currently is a culture of self-destruction. Pope
John Paul II’s phrase for this phenomenon is, “culture of death.” He has
stated many times that the “culture of death” must be replaced by a
“civilization of love.” The CLCC process is rooted in and promotes a
“civilization of love.” For the sake of building koinonia, community, in
parishes and the Church, an army of committed parishioners, properly formed
spiritually, must be deployed to fan out over the parish to home- visit all
lapsed Catholics in need of evangelization for return to the Church. To use
St. Paul’s battle cry, they must “put on the armor of God. Stand fast
… girded in truth, clothed with righteousness as a breastplate, feet shod in
readiness for the gospel of peace.” (Eph 6:13-15)</p>

          <p>C. Home Visitors are Builders of Community
1. The second motivation of members of Small Ecclesial Faith Communities, the
first being growing spiritually, is to prepare to go out into the parish to
“retrieve” the “living stones” which have fallen out of the house of God
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3825 **** -->(non-practicing Catholics) and “re-insert” them into the structure of the
Church, the “spiritual house … through Jesus Christ.” (cf. 1 Pet 2:5) Doing
this makes home visitors builders of koinonia, community. They seek out the
lapsed, inactive, alienated, wayward and fallen-away Catholics. With utmost
sensitivity toward the visited, home visitors are reminded that all baptized
persons belong irrevocably to the intimate family of God.
In graphic language St. Peter speaks of those who belong to Christ, the baptized
(cf. CCC 1141), as living stones, a royal priesthood, a chosen race, a holy
nation, a people of his own, a spiritual house. (cf. 1 Pet 2:9) Meaningful as
these designations are, they are generally unknown to Catholics, especially
those away from the Church a long time. They need to come to know the meaning of
these phrases. A good place is in a SEFC. Learning that the terms apply to them
can with God’s grace enkindle in their hearts and minds a desire to return to
the Church.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p30">
          <p>2. Why are the baptized called living stones? Because God the Father made his
Son “a cornerstone” for those who believe in him! Believers who assemble in
one place for worship of the Son are living stones gathered together, being
built and building up “a spiritual house.” (cf. CCC 1179, also 1268) Why are
those baptized called a royal priesthood? Because they participate in a “common
priesthood” with Christ who is Priest and King (cf. CCC 1141), and offer
spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. Why are those
baptized called a chosen race? Because Abraham’s faith was so great, God chose
his race and made a covenant with it that continued till after David’s time into
Christ’s end time. Through the Holy Spirit the “promised restoration” began.
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3850 **** -->The chosen who make up the kingdom “would belong to the poor according to the
Spirit.” (cf. CCC 709,710; also cf. Mt 5:3) Why are baptized persons called a
holy nation?“ Because once they were ”no people’ but now … are God’s
people.“ Why are the baptized called ”a people of his own?“ Because they had
once received no mercy, now (they) have received mercy.” (cf. 1 Pet 2:4-10)
Finally why are the baptized called “a spiritual house?” Because baptized
persons present themselves to Christ to be built into a spiritual house, an
“edifice of spirit,” the place where God dwells! They become a Holy City, the
New Jerusalem, a community of believers, (cf. CCC 756) whose God is Christ the Lord.</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p31">
          <p>3. Home visitors are moved to seek out the lapsed in their parish by these words
which God the Father spoke in prophecy about his God-Man Son, Jesus:
1 Pet 2:6
Behold, I [God] am laying a stone [Jesus, my Son] in Zion, a cornerstone, chosen
and precious, and whoever believes in it [in Jesus] shall not be put to shame.
This prophecy, states St. Peter, has “value” for those “who have faith.” But
he adds, “those without faith,” the “stone … will make people stumble … a
rock that will make them fall.” “They stumble by disobeying the word …” (1
Pet 2:7,8) Many, indeed millions, have “stumbled” because they are “without
faith,” even though they are baptized. Those who have stumbled, are, therefore,
in great need of evangelization.
Home visitors seek them out, visit them in their homes, hear their story
sympathetically, sometimes a sad, angry story, and warmly invite them to join a
SEFC in the parish in order to begin their trek back into the “spiritual
house” of God.

        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p32">
          <p>4. Each baptized Catholic, even if he is non-practicing, must come to realize
that he or she is a “living stone” of God’s house. Those having stumbled for
lack of faith, and who find themselves fallen away from the Church, should not
avoid those who seek them out. They should not resist the effort of home
visitors to retrieve them. Prayer and penance, as Jesus advised his disciples,
are the weapons by which to expel this kind of demon. (cf. Mk 9:29)</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p33">
          <p>Unfortunately the number of “living stones” that have fallen out of the
structure of the house of God, the Church, has reached a shocking estimated
75%, or about 47 million out of a total 63 million Catholics in the United
States. This falling out has severely weakened the Church. Thus home visitors
have a tremendously important and urgent apostolate: the job of finding those
who have stumbled, retrieving them in order to help them, strengthening their
weakened faith in a SEFC through the power of the Holy Spirit, and
“re-inserting” them into the “communion of believers,” the Church. Home
visitors are builders of community, koinonia.</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p34">
          <p>5. Models of home visitation abound in the New Testament. Jesus and Mary are of
course the principal models. Below are a few, though more could be added,
well-known gospel episodes showing the importance and effectiveness of making
visits to homes. We suggest that you look up these texts and be inspired by the
results that came from each visit:
Lk 1:39-45
Mary visits her cousin Elizabeth.
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3900 **** -->Mt 8:14-15
Jesus visits Peter’s mother-in-law.
Mt 26:6
Jesus visited Simon the Leper in his house in Bethany.
Lk 10:38-42
Jesus visits Mary and Martha.
Lk 19:1-10
Jesus visits Zaccheus, the tax collector.
Jn 2:1-2
Jesus and Mary visit a couple at their wedding in Cana.
Jn 4:4-42
Jesus visits with the Samaritan woman at the well
Jn 20:19-22
Jesus visited his apostles on the evening of the first day.
6. Front-line home visitors in a parish are the Matrix 12, the lay leaders of
the CLCC process and the priest. He is the leader, motivator and supporter of
this apostolate. Next are the laypersons that make up Small Ecclesial Faith
Communities (SEFC). Together they form a veritable brigade of missionaries who
visit the lapsed in their homes. Over many weeks of formation within their SEFC,
they have grown spiritually and gained a broader knowledge of the faith. Weekly
formation equips them spiritually to begin making home visits for
evangelization. Continuing to participate faithfully in ongoing weekly formation
in their SEFC is imperative. The better they are formed, the better home
visitors they make. Continuing their weekly formation sessions builds in them
confidence and zeal.
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3925 **** -->In the first two or three visits, they are unsure of themselves, as were the 72
disciples whom Jesus sent to evangelize in the villages. Home visitors reach out
to lapsed Catholics with the same feeling. Continuing spiritual formation in
SEFCs leads members to become confident missionaries unafraid to do everything
they prudently can to bring those who have “stumbled” into darkness “into his
[Christ’s] wonderful light.” (cf. 1 Pet 2:9)
What qualities should home visitors have for building up community in a parish?</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch10.Sx1.p35">
          <p>7. The first thing the person visited will look for is how genuine and friendly
is the visitor? What they see, what they hear and how it is said will have a
profound “make or break” impact on the person. The visitor must project

<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3950 **** -->Catholic, disclosure is the core of the visit. Usually the visited will want to
talk. The visitor must project total interest in the person’s story and
encourage him to go, while showing understanding and no impatience. After the
story is told, whether it is happy and grateful or sad, angry, accusatorial of
the church or priest or others, without comment and remaining completely
neutral, the visitor ventures to say kindly:
“Perhaps we can help you … [pause] … May we help you?”
The story out, the visited may be crying. If the visitor detects that the person
is open, the visitor shares what the Church can offer, for example a parish
mission statement, a weekly bulletin with Mass schedule, and other
information. The visitor briefly explains the CLCC process (offering a
brochure), explains what a Small Ecclesial Faith Community is, how it works,
what its goals are, and would the person be willing to come to a formation
session? Add pleasantly, “I’ll be happy to pick you up.” Tell the invited
visited person you would like to have him or her experience a spiritual
formation session and introduce the person to all the friendly members in the
SEFC. Assure the person he will enjoy meeting the group, and that the group is
anxious to meet the person.
The offer to pick him or her up shows the visited person that you are earnest
and that you are inviting him to something he will find engaging and
enlightening. Whatever personal views or problems the visited shares with the
visitor is held in strictest confidentiality. If the person’s problem centers on
an invalid marriage or is of another kind of religious or moral nature, the
visitor should encourage the person to speak with a priest, and offer, not urge,
to make an appointment for the person with the priest. All of this can and will
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 3975 **** -->succeed when carried out in the framework of profound Christian charity,
gentleness, prudence and prayer. Jesus’ powerful words must underlie the whole
visit, “without me you can do nothing.” (Jn 15:5)</p>

A. Home Visitors
1.As people grow older, they mature in wisdom. So too Catholics who grow in the
faith are impelled to do greater work in their parish. Running bingos, doing
bake sales and collecting pledges for fund drives have a value for sure. But
people who do these things begin to have a hunger for the “red meat” of
ministry. Spiritual and catechetical formation in SEFCs leads to seeing the need
of more fundamental pastoral action and the desire to do it. Home Visitation is
one such “red meat” ministry. Reflect on doing it; the good you will do for
others; the encouragement and example you will give to the timid and hesitant,
and the joy heaven will have over one sinner who repents. (cf.Lk15:7)</p>

example of faithful Catholics who attend Sunday Mass, receive the Sacraments,
some daily, who live the 10 Commandments faithfully, who have, raise and educate
their children according to the plan of God and Church teaching, and who train
them to be faith-filled, productive, patriotic Catholic citizens. For many
returnees to the faith, conversion may be a radical lifestyle change. Reflect:

duty? Charity! “Love your neighbor as yourself.” If charity is shallow, look
at incentive. Reread St. James’ statement, an apostle known for saying it as it

          <p>5. and 6.Outreach to non-church going Catholics, Pope John Paul II observed, is
a “challenge.” It’s not easy. Pope Paul VI put evangelization into a cultural
context. He said, cultures need to be evangelized because they are being
woefully de-Christianized in the name of freedom, personal rights, tolerance and
avoidance of discrimination. Prayerfully reflect on some cultural abominations
being legalized in this country that are totally contrary to the Christian way
of life. Share.</p>

to lapsed, non-church going Catholics are the two legs on which the CLCC process
stands. How else reach the lapsed if not by the “person-to-person” contact
that Pope Paul VI described as “indispensable?” Evangelization through the
Sunday homily is what he calls “collective proclamation.” He implies this
starts the job but does not complete it. An individual’s conscience must be
reached and touched by another individual, such as a home visitor. Invoke the
Holy Spirit for courage! Share.
9.Formation in holiness is a requirement without which one cannot do ministry
effectively. One may never say, “I’ve reached the top in holiness, now I’m
ready to evangelize.” Growth in holiness is a never-ending process that moves a
person forward and upward toward God in love. To stop the growth movement is to
go backward. Holiness is the dynamic that excites home visitors to retrieve
lapsed Catholics. In quiet time reflect how the Holy Spirit is inspiring you to

American Catholics know far too little about these documents.
Fortunately this book,Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian, contains the
central teaching of many of them in both Part I and II. Because millions of
Catholics live in the world like wheat in the midst of weeds (cf.Mt13:24-30),
they are exposed to and influenced by the world’s cultures, chief of which is
the “culture of death,” as stated by Pope John Paul II. Outreach to lapsed
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4150 **** -->Catholics, helping them return to Christ, is to practice the “civilization of
love.” It is in this way that koinonia, community, the Church of Christ’s love,
is built up. “Love one another as I love you,” said our Lord. (Jn15:12)

“spiritual house” which is Christ. Can you imagine anything more pleasing to
Christ than home visitors going out to find and gather up the living stones,
like pieces of a precious mosaic which have wiggled out of God’s art-piece, and
then restoring them to his Body, the Church? Reflect on the wonderful apostolate

darkness of ignorance, anxiety, anger, sin and absence of grace they stumbled,
that is, fell away from the Church. Many may now be secretly looking for a way

millions. To succeed in retrieving these “living stones” take Jesus’

          <p>Introduction
“Let everyone see us as servants of Christ and stewards of the
mysteries of God.” (1 Cor 4:1)
1. One of the great laments of the Catholic Church in the past several decades
is the millions of her members who have drifted away, no longer go to Mass, and
yet still call themselves “catholic.” Exodus from the Church began in the
troubled and rebellious 1960s. Whether the exodus has slowed down, or whether in
this new century significant numbers of lapsed Catholics will return to the
practice of the faith remains to be seen. Hopeful signs, however, of Catholics
in search of the true faith are appearing.
Millions of young people have gone on pilgrimage to be with the Holy Father for
World Youth Day celebrations in Denver, Rome, Toronto, Cologne, Sydney and
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4275 **** -->elsewhere. Here in the United States tens of thousands of young people, from
grade school to college, go to Washington, D.C. each year to join the March for
Life, bravely demonstrating they reject “choice” for abortion and defend
publicly the “right to life.” Thousands of college students are living
chastity in the midst of a culture of pre-marital sex. These are promising
signs. They are like tiny spring plants peering out of the still cold soil of
winter, showing the world around them their promising beauty when they bloom in
the spring and summer.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p3">
          <p>2. Another hopeful sign is the growing number of faith-filled Catholics who are
requesting pastors to have public exposition of the Blessed Sacrament in their
parishes. They want exposition in order to adore Jesus Christ during the day or
through the night, to deepen their faith in the mystery of Christ’s love. Their
desire is to grow in holiness, pray for peace in the world, invoke the Lord of
mercy for the conversion of sinners, especially lapsed family members, and to
make reparation for the multitude of sins, sacrileges and outrages committed
against the Lord in this sacrament. More and more devout Catholics in all parts
of the country are known to make a long drive, if necessary, to a church that
has public exposition all day or day and night when their own parish churches
have locked doors.</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p4">
          <p>3. When Jesus performed the two astounding miracles of the multiplication of
loaves feeding five thousand on one occasion (Mt 14:13-21) and four thousand on
another occasion (Mt 15:32-39), Jesus did not do this only out of compassion to
feed their bodily hunger. He performed the miracles to prefigure his institution
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4300 **** -->of the Holy Eucharist at the Last Supper, by which he would feed countless
masses of believing disciples for all ages with the food of his Body and
Blood. This is the mystery of God, the mystery of the REAL PRESENCE, Jesus, true
God and true Man, present in his body and blood, soul and divinity on our altars
in the Mass and in church tabernacles. Puzzling and inexplicable, this is the
“mystery” of which the Lord made us “stewards.” It draws millions of
believers to adore it on the one hand, and on the other hand is the excuse
millions of Catholics give for leaving the Church because they no longer believe
it.</p>

          <p>4. Recall Jesus’ discourse to the crowd. He said seriously that his body was
real food and his blood real drink, and that whoever eats and drinks of it will
have “eternal life”, that is, the person, the believer, would be raised up
“on the last day.” (cf. Jn 6:54,55) On hearing this stupendous truth coming
from the mouth of Jesus, many believed. But many did not. They dissented. “This
saying is hard,” they said. Refusing to “accept it” and “murmuring about
this … many … returned to their former way of life.” (cf. Jn 6:60-66) Those
of faith, however, feel privileged and unworthy to be stewards of the Eucharist.</p>

has a parallel. What Jesus did in Galilee, the laity re-enact in the parish. In
Stage 5, Jesus came up from Galilee to Jerusalem to carry out his final and
enduring acts of redemption. He held his Last Supper with his Apostles followed
by his Passion, Crucifixion, Death and Resurrection, all of which were climaxed
with the power of the Lord on the day of Pentecost. At the parish level, Stage 5
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4325 **** -->is carried out when all members of Small Ecclesial Faith Communities, and all
parishioners assemble to celebrate the Eucharist. Through the power of the Holy
Spirit, they take “part in the Eucharistic Sacrifice, which is the source and
summit of the whole Christian life … offer the divine Victim to God, and
… themselves along with it.” (LG 11; also Ecclesia de Eucharistia, Church of

          <p>A. The Eucharist, God’s Greatest Gift to Man
1. It is no coincidence that the 3,000 bishops who participated in Vatican
Council II (Years 1962-1965) made, in the words of Pope Paul VI, “the liturgy
… the first subject to be examined,” showing thereby its “intrinsic worth
and importance for the life of the Church.” Its worth and importance for the
Church’s worship was carefully crafted by the Council Fathers and issued in 1963
in a document titled Sacrosanctum Concilium, SC, better known as the
Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p8">
          <p>2. Part Two, Section Two, Chapter One, Article 3 (paragraphs 1322-1419) of the
Catechism of the Catholic Church treats the Sacrament of the Eucharist. It
quotes the Council’s Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy and other documents of
Vatican II, especially Lumen Gentium, the Dogmatic Constitution of the Church,
where references are made to the Holy Eucharist. In his encyclical Ecclesia de
Eucharistia, “the Church of the Eucharist,” issued on Holy Thursday, April 17,
2003, Pope John Paul II quotes the Catechism, several documents of Vatican
Council II, many Greek and Latin Fathers of the Church, and saints who have
distinguished themselves for their writings and preaching on the Holy
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4350 **** -->Eucharist. Thus, we, the Church, are gifted with an enormously rich body of
authentic and beautiful teachings on the Holy Eucharist. They are to be read,
studied and applied to ourselves first for advancing in personal holiness and
for building community,koinonia, in the Church and the world through the dynamic
of “communio.”
The Eucharist is God the Father’s supreme gift of his beloved Son to us
3. How do we know this? We have been raised to the dignity of royal priesthood
by Baptism, have we not? Have we not been configured to Christ in the Sacrament
of Confirmation? In the Eucharist we participate in the Lord’s own sacrifice
(cf. CCC 1322), the most central action of this mystery. Active participation in
it began to take shape on Holy Thursday evening “at the Last Supper, on the
night he was betrayed,” when the Father’s Son, our “Savior instituted the
Eucharistic sacrifice of his Body and Blood.” “This he did in order to
perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages, until he should come
again, and so to entrust to his beloved Spouse, the Church, a memorial of his
death and resurrection: a sacrament of love, a sign of unity, a bond of charity,
a Paschal banquet, in which Christ is consumed, the mind is filled with grace,
and a pledge of future glory is given to us.” (CCC 1323; emphasis added)
Participation by baptized believers in this memorial is then not only a gift of
unfathomable value but the monumental truth by which the Church exists, acts and
worships.</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p9">
          <p>4. In his encyclical, Ecclesia de Eucharistia, the fourteenth of his
pontificate, Pope John Paul II titled the first chapter “The Mystery of
Faith.” Indeed, the Holy Eucharist is a “mystery,” a reality that the human
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4375 **** -->mind cannot fathom, but by the gift of faith accepts and believes. The Holy
Father emphasizes that the Eucharist is a sacrifice, a sacrifice “marked
indelibly by the events of Jesus’ passion and death.” The Eucharist is not just
a “reminder” of these events but the “sacramental re-presentation” of his
sacrifice on the Cross. That this “sacramental re-presentation” is a mystery
is proclaimed at every Mass. After the consecration does not the presiding
priest call out to the assembly, “Let us proclaim the mystery of faith,” to
which the assembly responds enthusiastically with one of the approved
acclamations such as: “Dying you destroyed our death, rising you restored our
life, Lord Jesus, come in glory.”
“When the Church celebrates the Eucharist, the memorial of her Lord’s death and
resurrection, this central event of salvation becomes really present and ’the
work of our redemption is carried out.”’ (EE 11; also cf. LG 3) This sacrifice
is so focal to the whole plan of man’s salvation, that Christ would not think of
returning to the Father “only after he left us a means of sharing in it
[emphasis added] as if we had been present” beneath the Cross on Calvary. The
“means of sharing in it” is the Eucharist. It is “the gift par excellence.”
It is the person of Christ in his sacred humanity. It is the gift of himself as
God-Man. It is “the gift of his saving work” that “transcends all times.”
(cf. CCC 1085) It is the “inestimable gift,” the Mystery of Faith. It is also
the mystery of mercy, God showing his love for man “to the end” (cf. Jn 13:1),
a love which knows no measure. (cf. EE 11)</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p10">
          <p>Absolutely central to the Holy Eucharist is its sacrificial meaning
5. Sacrifice and its meaning must be fully understood and appreciated. The
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4400 **** -->Eucharist is at once a real sacrifice and a sacrament. The sacrifice on Calvary
happened once. The sacrifice on our Catholic altars takes place repeatedly. It
is a re-presentation of Christ’s one sacrifice on the Cross. It is through the
Eucharistic re-presentation, the Mass, that the sacrifice of Christ on the Cross
is visibly enacted on the altar. By this Eucharistic sacrifice Christ reconciles
men and women to himself in every age. Thus, “the sacrifice of Christ and the
sacrifice of the Eucharist are one single sacrifice.” (CCC 1367)
The one sacrifice is also the sacrament, the sacrifice on the Cross
repeated. What appears to be “bread” is“ living bread” (cf. Jn 6:51; also
cf. 6:35,48), the real Body of Christ. What appears to be “wine” is Jesus’
Sacred Blood. In appearance, taste and smell, the sacramental Body and Blood of
Jesus look like bread and wine. They are the sacrament, the visible sign. In
this sign Jesus makes his real Body and Blood eatable and drinkable. Only
through the eyes of faith do we know that the sacrificial meaning, the
Eucharist, is really and truly the Body and Blood of Christ.</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p11">
          <p>What about the “real presence?”
6. Practicing Catholics of faith deeply revere the real presence of Christ in
the Eucharist. It is an awesome reality. They firmly believe that Jesus Christ,
true God and true Man, resides in this mysterious form. Some, however, harbor
doubts about it, others tend to disbelieve it and others deny it outright as
myth. What is the truth? Is Christ really and truly present in the Eucharist or
is he not?
The Catechism of the Catholic Church identifies at least ten ways by which
Christ is present in his Church. The most outstanding way is that “he is
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4425 **** -->present most especially in the Eucharistic species.” (cf. CCC 1373) His
presence is “unique.” In the Sacrament of the Eucharist his presence is
superior to all other sacraments because all other sacraments tend to it. In the
most holy Eucharist the Lord Jesus, “body and blood, together with soul and
divinity,” the whole Christ is truly, really and substantially
contained. “Real” means that he is present “in the fullest sense: that is to
say, it is a substantial presence by which Christ, God and man, makes himself
wholly and entirely present.” (CCC 1374; also Paul VI, Mysterium Fidei 39)</p>

          <p>Transubstantiation! What is it?
7. The word is heard in homilies, used in catechetical works, and taught in RCIA
and bible studies. What exactly is it? Transubstantiation is the complete and
total “conversion” of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ. When
Jesus spoke the words at the Last Supper, “This is my Body” over the bread,
and “This is my blood” over the cup of wine, he was speaking as God and
Man. His human words had the power of God. A complete change, a “conversion,”
of the material bread and wine took place. (cf. CCC 1375) The power of Jesus’
words was witnessed by the crowds when for example he said to the paralytic,
“stand and walk.” He got up and walked.
When Jesus speaks the words of institution (“consecration”) over the bread and
wine through the voice of the priest, the bread and wine are changed, that is,
substantially “transformed.” (cf. CCC 1375) The bread becomes Christ’s Body;
the wine becomes Christ’s blood. What we see are only “visible signs,” the
sacrament. What we do not see with our eyes but believe with all our hearts and
minds is that Jesus makes himself present on the altar, his body and blood, his
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4450 **** -->soul and divinity. This total and complete change, “conversion,” is called
transubstantiation. (CCC 1376)
This conversion is the “ultimate Mystery of Faith.” It “surpasses our
understanding and can only be received in faith.” St. Cyril of Jerusalem
exhorts his congregation, “Do not see in the bread and wine merely natural
elements, because the Lord has expressly said that they are his body and blood:
faith assures you of this, though your senses suggest otherwise.” (cf. EE 15)</p>

          <p>The next Mystery of Faith, Communion
8. The Eucharist is often referred to as a banquet. Is this metaphorical
language? Is Holy Communion a banquet? We know that the Eucharist is God’s
greatest gift to man. It is God the Father’s gift of his only-begotten Son,
Jesus, to us. Holding the bread, he said to the Apostles, “take and eat…”
Holding the cup of wine, he said, “take this and drink…” Jesus’ Body and
Blood on the altar create a “real presence” to us. But they were not meant to
sit there, but to be taken, eaten and drunk. And the eating and drinking were to
have an effect on those who ate and drank. The effect would be a “saving
efficacy.” (EE 16)
To receive the Body and Blood is called communion, to have union with Christ, so
intimate that there is no comparable union on earth. The saving efficacy is
expressed in these words of Jesus at the institution: “It [my blood] will be
shed for you and for all so that sins may be forgiven.” Familiar words?
In Holy Communion “we receive the very One who offered himself for us; we
receive his body which he gave up for us on the Cross and his blood which he
’poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.”’ (cf. Mt 26:28; EE 16) This
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4475 **** -->means that Eucharistic Communion forgives venial sins, nourishes us to avoid all
sin and strengthens us to strive for greater holiness. (CCC 1394) How necessary
it is to recall these words of Jesus: “Just as the living Father sent me and I
have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life
because of me.” (Jn 6:57) The Father is “life” and the Eucharist is divine
food which Jesus effected by the Holy Spirit. To receive communion is therefore
to receive the eternal Godhead, the Blessed Trinity, God in his indivisible
Oneness. Thus, the Eucharist is a true banquet. “Amen, amen, I say to you,
unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have
life within you.” (Jn 6:53) Clearly this is no metaphorical food. Jesus said,
“For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.” (Jn 6:55; cf. EE 16)</p>

          <p>B. Stewardship of the Eucharist
Responsibility to oneself
1. This Stage of the CLCC process is titled Stewards of the Eucharist. Intrinsic
to the concept of stewardship is the all-important element of responsibility,
for stewardship and responsibility are twin realities that are tightly
linked. What responsibilities do Stewards of the Eucharist have? The first is to
themselves. They must be aware of what they are doing when they receive the Body
and Blood of Christ in Holy Communion. Specifically they must be without serious
sin, alive in the state of grace. They should have other dispositions too:
repentance, love of God and full awareness of what they are doing. They must
believe firmly in the gift of the Eucharist, have sorrow for even venial sins,
fast at least one hour before receiving Holy Communion, be mindful of the ONE
they are receiving and do so with reverence. They should be respectfully
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4500 **** -->attired, and after receiving the Lord make the sign of the cross devoutly. Upon
return to their places, each communicant should make a loving thanksgiving.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p15">
          <p>Responsibility to others
2. The second responsibility is to others. We must be aware that we belong to
the earthly branch of the tri-level Communion of Saints. We belong to the
worldwide body of over one billion baptized Catholics on journey to heaven. Our
second responsibility therefore is to the vast mass of baptized Catholics within
that body who have left the Church and no longer go to Mass. Stewardship of the
Eucharist requires us to reach out to non-church-goers. They must be made aware
of the unsurpassable gift they are missing, and who either out of ignorance,
doubt or even denial do not realize that their salvation is in grave jeopardy.
Stewardship of the Eucharist demands that on our pilgrim way to eternity, we try
to plant the seeds of conversion to Christ in those in need of conversion,
reaching out to them, bringing them into a Small Ecclesial Faith Community for
re-introduction to the Mystery of Faith and the Holy Eucharist. (cf. CCC 1396)
Each time we receive the Eucharist we should strengthen our sense of
responsibility for helping lapsed Catholics return to Christ, and be especially
eager to help those outside of the Church who are sincerely seeking salvation to
come into the Church of the Eucharist. (cf. EE 20)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p16">
          <p>3. What needs to be remembered is that Catholics who are lapsed are not always
personally at fault. They may be victims of injustice and discrimination. They
may be de-humanized through terrible poverty, made powerless and victims of
exploitation with almost no hope for a future. They need the gifts given at the
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4525 **** -->Last Supper. They need their faith and hope awakened in Christ in the
Eucharist. They need “washing of the feet,” the symbol of cleansing in order
to have a place in Christ’s kingdom. “Cleansing” begins in Small Ecclesial
Faith Communities. Here the lapsed are wanted, welcomed and “rehabilitated”
spiritually, even materially when possible, receiving catechesis from caring
fellow Catholics, love, and a way for re-entering the Church.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p17">
          <p>4. As responsible stewards of the Eucharist, attention must be given to low Mass
attendance and to action that will correct it. One effective action is
Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian, the CLCC process. One American
Cardinal called this process “the best” in his opinion. The CLCC process is
not just subjectively centered on an individual’s personal spiritual growth, but
is simultaneously focused outward. It reaches out to baptized Catholics who have
strayed from the Church. It seeks them out, and strives to help them celebrate
their lives as Catholic Christians. The reasons for low Mass attendance are
many. The first is wholly deficient training of young people in their formative
years in solid, authentic religious education; the woeful lack of doctrinal
substance in many catechetical materials; religion teachers giving fundamental
truths contained in the Ten Commandments, the Creed, the Sacraments, especially
Penance and Eucharist, hurried treatment, and failure to give students strong
training on the importance, need and power of prayer.
Also many seminaries have failed to give its students for priesthood in the late
60s up to the early 90s a vigorous training in orthodox theology and
ecclesiology. Many seminarians did not receive a firm foundation in philosophy,
in the discipline of liturgy stated explicitly in Sacrosanctum Concilium, SC,
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4550 **** -->Vatican II’s Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy and clarified in numerous
documents issued since then by the Vatican for uniform worship and the
correction of irregularities which creep into sacramental
celebration. Fortunately many seminaries today give their students a rigorous
training in all the curricular disciplines, in total fidelity to the Church, the
Magisterium and inculcate respect for and obedience to the Holy Father, their
local bishop and major superiors.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p18">
          <p>5. Other reasons responsible for deterioration of the already weak faith of
millions resulting in departure from the Church are Entertainment Masses and
Self-Celebration Masses. These in the long run scandalize rather than edify the
People of God. Some priests and parish liturgical committees are “sold” at
times on bringing a comedy atmosphere to the holy Sacrifice of the Mass. It’s a
way, they believe, to attract children, keep their attention and instill in them
a good feeling toward Church-going, and lessen the hassle parents have with kids
who do not want to go to Mass. The kids say they’re bored, won’t open their
mouths to sing or respond to prayers, say it’s too long (60 minutes at most) and
that they don’t get anything out of devoutly celebrated Masses. But three to
four hours of TV every day at home is too little. Entertainment Masses are those
where the celebrant is the center of attention, not the Lord present on the
altar or in the tabernacle. They are Masses where the presiding priest doesn’t
miss a chance to say something cute or funny whether in the liturgy of the Word
or the liturgy of the Eucharist to get a laugh, even applause to make the people
“feel good.”
Another kind of self-celebration Mass is when the assembly celebrates itself. We
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4575 **** -->are Church! Jesus is in us and with us (“where two or three are gathered….”)
We are gathered to celebrate oneness and we top it off with a communal meal,
meaning Holy Communion. Might this idea of Eucharistic worship remind us of the
parable of the self-glorifying Pharisee and the self-effacing tax-collector, the
Publican, worshiping in the temple? (cf. Lk 18:9-14) Masses which are banal,
trivialized and exhibitionistic, are they building up faith or tearing it down?
In the measure that transparent holiness at Mass decreases, absence from Mass
increases.
In Ecclesia de Eucharistia, the Holy Father speaks sadly of “shadows” that are
blurring the “lights” which shine in Eucharistic celebrations. He speaks of
the need to banish effectively “the dark clouds of unacceptable doctrine and
practice, so that the Eucharist will continue to shine forth in all its radiant
beauty.” He states that it is his hope that his Encyclical Letter will
correct the “abuses [that] have occurred in various parts of the Church.”
(cf. EE 10). The only way non-practicing Catholics can and will return to the
Church is when Mass becomes again an experience of transcending beauty, an
experience in faith and love, devotion to and reverence for the real presence of
Christ in the Eucharist.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p19">
          <p>Return to the Church will assuredly begin when the Eucharist is preached often
from personal conviction and sincere belief. Like the tax collector many lapsed
Catholics are looking for the Lord’s loving mercy to cleanse their guilt-laden
hearts. They will return to the Lord with repentant hearts. They plead for
forgiveness and it is given them. They thank him for his goodness, and he
accepts it. They want the warmth of the Savior’s love, and he returns it a
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4600 **** -->hundred fold. This is Mass and this is what the Lord does in the Mass if we let
him.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p20">
          <p>6. Not a few Catholics who were poorly educated in the faith have adopted some
trendy heresies that militate against belief in the Holy Eucharist, either
directly or indirectly. These heresies also contribute to departure from the
Church. One is the mistaken idea of “freedom”, and in particular freedom of
conscience. Today the notion of freedom has gone wild. Great numbers of
Catholics think freedom means one can do as he pleases. They reject the true
meaning of freedom that one can and should do what is right. Out of control
freedom is largely the cause of crimes committed by adults and youth. It is also
the cause of abuse of the sacred institution of matrimony, the widespread
breakdown of family, and the practice of grave moral and social evils such as
artificial contraception, masturbation, abortion, active homosexuality and same
sex partnerships. The liberal notion of freedom, they feel, allows them to break
the laws of God with impunity. For example, couples feel free to live together
shamelessly in public sin before marrying, giving untold scandal to the young
and painful sorrow to older people especially God-fearing, moral parents.
Co-habitating couples who marry are off to a shaky start as studies show. Many
receive the sacrament of matrimony in sin because they do not go to confession
before their wedding. Without the aid of God’s grace, these marriages have only
about a 50% chance of being permanent and happy. They face a 50% prospect of
divorce and all the societal ravages that flow from divorce. Children of such
marriages are often abused, neglected and made to feel unwanted. Many grow up
severely maladjusted and emotionally immature. Many launch into early sexual
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4625 **** -->activity, into drugs, become rebellious toward parental authority and defiant of
civil authority. Not all separations, however, are the result of a misguided
notion of freedom. Other factors enter that make marital separation, divorce or
annulments justifiable in order to preserve sanity and human dignity. (cf. CCC
2384)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p21">
          <p>7. The second heresy is denial of sin. Having been told or taught that there is
no serious sin, no punishment for sin, no hell only heaven, and no matter how
grossly sinful one may be, God’s love and mercy prevail, and salvation is
certain. THIS IS NOT TRUE. Did not Jesus, the God-Man come to earth specifically
to forgive men’s sins and save man from the eternal death of damnation? In the
Eucharistic Sacrifice of the Mass does not Jesus say most solemnly at the
consecration, “this is the cup of my blood…It will be shed for you and for
all so that sins may be forgiven?” Related to the denial of sin is the
destructive popular heresy of tolerance. No matter what people do or say
regardless how corrupting it is to the fabric of society, how offensive to God,
how evil and repugnant to decent persons, as long as it is not legally criminal,
look the other way. Be tolerant! Live with “diversity!”</p>

          <p>8. As informed and compassionate Catholics, we may not accept the gay and
lesbian lifestyles as normal. Yet powerful, gay political pressure is being
forced upon us. Homosexuality means that certain men and women “experience an
exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex.”
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4650 **** -->Homosexual actions between two men or two women is according to Sacred Scripture
a “grave depravity,” and therefore “intrinsically disordered.” (CCC 2357;
cf. Gen 19:1-29; Rom 1:24-27; 1 Cor 6:10; 1 Tim 1:10; also cf. Lev 18:22; 20:13)
Such actions are “disordered” because they close off the possibility of
transmission of life that is achievable only through the “sexual
complementarity” of husband and wife. (CCC 2357) Thus, homosexual activity may
not be tolerated, and under no circumstances approved. Same-sex inclination is
present in many persons and is for them a real “trial.” “Every sign of unjust
discrimination … should be avoided, and respect, compassion and sensitivity
should be shown them, always careful not to give the least sign of
endorsement.” (CCC 2358)
Like everyone else homosexual persons are called to chastity. No matter how
strong the inclination, it can be brought under control through honest
self-evaluation, freedom of will to want to choose between good and evil, and
through the powerful strength of God’s grace obtained by daily prayer,
sacramental confession and Holy Communion. Homosexual persons can and must
travel the road of Christian perfection like every other Christian. (cf. CCC
2359)</p>

          <p>9. As responsible Stewards of the Eucharist, we have an obligation to defend our
true faith and Church against the influences of a third heresy, religious
relativism, yet another cause of Catholics defecting from the Church. We are
irrevocably members of the one, holy, Catholic and apostolic Church which Christ
founded and preserves through his divine power and loving protection. Despite
countless assaults, plots and persecutions in fierce efforts to destroy her over
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4675 **** -->her two thousand year history, the Church stands firm and indestructible as
Jesus promised, “The powers of hell shall not prevail against her.” (Mt 16:18)
Religious relativism claims all religions are equal, that one religion is as
good as another. Skeptics claim also that “salvation,” if really necessary,
can be attained without Christ. This is gross heresy. To refute popular errors,
the Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a Declaration,
titled Dominus Iesus, August 6, 2000, On the Unicity and Salvific Universality
of Jesus Christ and the Church (DI).
What does this mean? That the Church is One in Christ and that salvation for all
mankind is through Christ alone and no one else and in his Church. “Christ
… Jesus of Nazareth … is the Word of God made man for the salvation of
all.” (DI 10) “Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called
to one and the same destiny, which is divine, we must hold that the Holy Spirit
offers to all the possibility of being made partners … in the paschal
mystery.” (DI 12) St. Peter standing before the Sanhedrin in defense of healing
the crippled man said boldly, “There is salvation in no one else, for there is
no other name under heaven given men by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12; DI
13) “The Lord Jesus, the only Savior, did not only establish a simple community
of disciples, but constituted the Church as a salvific mystery: he himself is in
the Church and the Church is in him.” (DI 16) “Jesus Christ continues his
presence and his work of salvation in the Church and by means of the Church.”
(DI 16) “The Church is the ’universal sacrament of salvation.”’ (DI 20)
To some ears the above statements and biblical texts may sound discriminatory,
elitist and intolerant of other religions. The Declaration is a definitive
reiteration of basic truths that the Catholic Church has preached, taught and
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4700 **** -->lived by for over two thousand years and objectors will not intimidate
her. Jesus did say, “I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the
Father except through me.” (Jn 14:6)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p24">
          <p>10. A fourth destructive influence that causes loss of faith and departure from
the Church are the Culture Wars. These are conflicts between certain Catholic
truths and secular powers and civil legislation. The most deadly conflict is
between celebrating life versus killing unborn life. It is the lead issue in the
socio-political and socio-ecclesial culture wars. The reason is that the
majority of Catholics, Christians and persons of good will are passionately
pro-life and a minority of other people equally passionate but more vocal,
organized and well-funded promotes the so-called “right” of women to kill
their unborn child. The conflict becomes messy when high-profile Catholic
politicians defend and vote for abortion and partial birth abortion even though
Church teaching rejects their “dual conscience” stance as untenable:
“Personally I’m pro-life; publicly I’m pro-choice. I can’t impose my morality
on others.”
Pope John Paul II and other pontiffs say that this dualistic position may not be
held by a Catholic and still be in good standing in the Church. In his 11th
encyclical, Evangelium Vitae, The Gospel of Life, EV, John Paul II raises the
issue of “personal conscience … in the public sphere” as he does in other
teachings. In a democracy the “majority rules.” If abortion or any other
anti-life issue is legalized, the Catholic politician must separate himself or
herself from the public position. In conscience the Catholic politician must
acknowledge “an objective moral law which is natural law written in the human
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4725 **** -->heart” as superior and overriding civil law. Not to do so is to espouse
“ethical relativism which characterizes much of present-day culture.” Catholic
politicians and ordinary Catholic citizens are in conscience bound to take a
strong, consistent pro-life stand. Not to do so is to remove oneself from
communion with the Church. (cf. EV 69,70; also 57,62)
Other cultural conflicts exist: atheism vs. Catholicism, error vs. truth,
dissent vs. obedience, abortion vs. sacredness of life, public education
vs. home schooling, the culture of death vs. the civilization of love, liberal
vs. conservative, progressive vs. traditionalist, war hawks vs. peace doves,
radical feminists vs. white males. More could be added. The reality is that
culture wars are pervasive and impact powerfully all persons, adults, young
people, seniors and children. Let’s be bold and wise. Let’s be Stewards of the
Eucharist. All the above cultural conflicts challenge us to be responsible
stewards of the Eucharist. We have Christ, the God Man, He is with us. He gave
himself to us. Therefore who can be against us? Let us reach out to help the
lapsed, religiously illiterate and excommunicated Catholics return to the Church
and the Eucharist. Celebrate Life as Catholic Christians!</p>

          <p>C. Eucharist and Catholic Worship
1. In order to worship in faith and receive Holy Communion in the state of
grace, it is highly recommended that the Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation
be received frequently. If a person is in grievous sin he is obliged to confess
his sins and be in the state of grace before receiving Holy Communion. Only when
in the state of grace does Holy Communion benefit the communicant
spiritually. To receive Holy Communion while in known mortal sin the communicant
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4750 **** -->commits sacrilege, “the profaning or treating unworthily the sacraments.”
Sacrilege is most grave “when committed against the Eucharist … the sacrament
of the true Body of Christ made substantially present to us.” (CCC 2120)
Prior to confession it is necessary to examine one’s conscience. This means to
recall and know the nature of one’s serious sins. Examination of conscience is
also useful in preparation for confession of venial sins. To grow in holiness
frequent confession of venial sins and faults increases grace in the soul. What
can be more remedial than to know that through the absolution that the priest
gives, it is Christ himself who forgives our sins? And he does so as often as we
receive the sacrament. The grace received in this sacrament helps us grow in
love of God, love of neighbor and in holiness of life. Parishioners who belong
to Small Ecclesial Faith Communities are urged to receive the Sacrament of
Penance often for their own spiritual benefit first of all. They also give good
example to lapsed Catholics who have come into a SEFC. By example returning
Catholics will gain some idea of the value of frequent confession, and the joy,
peace and blessings it gives. Purification and sanctification of the person
through this sacrament makes Catholic worship of the Eucharist more meaningful
and spiritually fruitful.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p26">
          <p>2. The basis of Catholic worship is the first of God’s 10 Commandments given to
Moses for his people on Mt. Sinai. The traditional formula of the First
Commandment is: I am the Lord your God, you shall not have strange Gods before
me. Lengthier texts of the First Commandment are given in Exodus 20:2-17 and
Deuteronomy 5:6-21. (cf. CCC pp. 496-497) The formula above is the approved
synthesis of the two longer texts. The 10 Commandments are called the
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4775 **** -->“Decalogue,” the “ten words.” The Pharisees and Sadducees, in animated but
inconclusive discussion among themselves about the Decalogue, decided to test
Jesus by asking, “Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?”
Jesus’ reply to the “scholar” who asked the question, “You shall love the
Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your
mind. This is the greatest and the first commandment.” (Mt 22:37-38). St. Luke
in his gospel adds “…and with all your strength.” (Lk 10:27) Worship of God
therefore is worship of the God of love with total love.
When the Evil One tempted Jesus on the mountain showing him “all the kingdoms
of the world in their magnificence” and bribing him said, “All these I shall
give to you, if you prostrate yourself and worship me.” With scorching disdain,
Jesus said to him, “Get away, Satan! It is written: ’The Lord, your God, shall
you worship and him alone shall you serve.”’ (Mt 4:8-10, Jesus citing Deut 6:13)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p27">
          <p>Worship is an act of religion (cf. CCC 2096)
3. Broadly defined religion is a person’s relationship with God. It consists of
belief in him (faith), placing confidence in his goodness, trusting he will care
for and protects us (hope), and loving him, uniting oneself with him through
prayer and service (charity). These fundamental virtues, the top virtue being
charity, require, in fact demand, that human creatures render to God what is
owed him as Creator in justice. We owe God first of all adoration. To adore God
means “to acknowledge him as God and Savior, as Lord and Master of everything
that exists, and thank him for his infinite and merciful love.” (CCC 2096)
Worship includes adoring God with the right dispositions, namely with “respect
and absolute submission” realizing the “nothingness of the creature” who
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4800 **** -->would not exist were it not for God. Worship means to adore God with praise,
exalting him and humbling oneself before him, expressing gratitude for all the
great things he has done and does for us each moment of every day. To worship
God turns us outward from ourselves setting us free to overcome temptations to
self-importance and reject the enticements and idolatry of the world. (cf. CCC
2097) Worship includes also key components such as prayer, vocal and mental,
meditation and contemplation, veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the
saints, and above all adoration of the One God in Three Persons of the Trinity,
God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit.
4. The Catholic Church believes strongly in what takes place at the consecration
of the Mass. Christ gives himself wholly and truly to his Church in the
Eucharist. Millions of martyrs have died in defense of this great truth. The
truth is that Christ himself instituted the Eucharist and is himself, “the
source and summit of the Christian life.” (cf. LG 11) Why does the Church
believe so strongly in this mystery that takes place at the consecration?
Because on the authority and power of Jesus’ words an extraordinary change takes
place, a change of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the
body of Christ our Lord and of the whole substance of the wine into the
substance of his blood. This change is properly called
transubstantiation. (cf. A.7. above; also CCC 1376)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p28">
          <p>The Holy Eucharist, therefore, is the “sublime cause” which unites divine life
with human life. The Eucharist brings baptized believers into oneness with
Christ, the God Man, and with each other. It is the Eucharist that builds “a
spiritual edifice,” that unique and holy community called the Church. The
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4825 **** -->Eucharist “is the culmination both of God’s action of sanctifying the world in
Christ, and the worship men offer to Christ, and through him worship the Father
in the Holy Spirit.” (cf. CCC 1325) Because the Eucharist is “the source and
summit of the Christian life,” it demands our most devout and universal worship.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p29">
          <p>5. Central to devout worship of the Eucharist, whether in the Mass and outside
of Mass, is that we express our belief that Christ is really present in the
signs of consecrated bread and wine. Reverence towards these sacred signs
demands that we genuflect or bow profoundly on entering and leaving a Catholic
church. When crossing before the tabernacle where the Sacrament is reserved a
genuflection or deep bow should be made. These are signs of adoration of the
Lord. When the Eucharist is exposed on the altar for solemn public veneration,
or carried in procession, utmost care must be given the Sacrament that it be
adored appropriately by all, clergy, altar servers, worshipers in the pews or
those standing on the street if the Eucharist is carried in public to another
place for adoration as perhaps on the solemn feast of Corpus Christi. (cf. CCC
1378)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p30">
          <p>6. Worship of the Eucharist is first and foremost a celebration of the community
of believers who acknowledge and adore the Lord Jesus in his real presence. The
Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy states it in this way. “The Church has never
failed to come together to celebrate the paschal mystery … the Eucharist in
which the victory and triumph of his death are again made present and at the
same time giving thanks to God for his unspeakable gift of Christ Jesus ’to the
praise of his glory,’ through the power of the Holy Spirit.” (SC 6) In fact,
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4850 **** -->the Constitution also states: “every liturgical celebration, because it is an
action of Christ the priest and of his Body, the Church, is a sacred action
surpassing all others. No other action of the Church can match its claim to
efficacy, nor equal the degree of it.” (SC 7) Without doubt, therefore, Christ
is the principal agent and center of Eucharistic worship. “Christ always
associates the Church with himself in the truly great work of giving perfect
praise to God and making men holy. The Church is his dearly beloved Bride who
calls to her Lord, and through him offers worship to the Eternal Father.” (SC 7)</p>

          <p>D. Eucharist and the Celebration of Sunday
1. What is the primary day for worship of the Eucharist? Sunday, the Day of the
Lord! The third commandment of God is expressed by this traditional catechetical
formula: Remember to keep holy the LORD’S Day. (CCC page 496) On July 7, 1998
Pope John Paul II issued an apostolic letter to the Universal Church titled Dies
Domini, the Day of the Lord, DD. In it he speaks of the Day of the Lord, the Day
of the Church and the Day of Man.</p>

          <p>Sunday, the Day of the Lord
2. After creating the world God celebrated his creation. It was the seventh day,
a day of rest, (Gen 2:2), not a day of idleness or divine “inactivity,” but a
“day of divine contemplation.” He “gazed” upon the beauty of his
achievement. (DD 11) His day of rest was also a “gaze” into the
future. “All-knowing” he saw the “glory of the risen Christ” in “the
festival of the ’new creation,”’ when “the Word was made flesh in the fullness
of time.” (Gal 4:4; DD 8) The inseparable unity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4875 **** -->the One God in three divine Persons, was at work. His work was fully revealed in
the paschal mystery, in Jesus, his God-Man Son, in his passion, death and
resurrection. Thus the divine creating Father had much to celebrate “at the
beginning” and continues to celebrate till the end of time. (cf. DD 8)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p33">
          <p>“God blessed the Seventh Day and Made It Holy.” (Gen 2:3) The “seventh day”
is therefore special. The all-holy One made it “holy” in his creative plan. It
is holy because it defines and indelibly expresses God’s relation to man and
man’s relation with God. Furthermore the Day was “announced and expounded by
biblical revelation.” This means that God explicitly stated it was “holy” in
his revealed word. (cf. DD 13) Because the Seventh Day is holy, it is also a day
of “rest,” a day set apart from other days, (DD 14) and a day of
“remembering.” “Remembering” centers on the grand work of God in his
creation, and on God’s creatures nourishing their religious life on the “day of
rest.” (cf. DD 16) “Remembering” includes “the work of liberation
accomplished by God in the Exodus, ” (cf. Deut 5:15; DD 17); and remembering
the “new beginning” which Jesus inaugurated by his death and resurrection, the
“festive day … on which the Lord rose from the dead.” (DD 18) As responsible
Stewards of the Eucharist, we remember to keep holy the Lord’s Day.</p>

          <p>Sunday, The Day of Christ, Dies Christi
3. Even though Sunday is the Lord’s Day, a day of “rest” which is “holy,”
Sunday is the venerable day for celebrating the Lord’s resurrection. Christian
Sunday leads the faithful each week to ponder and live the event of Easter, the
true source of the world’s salvation. (cf. DD 19) Sunday has the distinction of
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4900 **** -->being the first day of the week. After the resurrection that occurred on “the
first day after the Sabbath,” the apostles began to celebrate the first day of
the week as the day upon which the faithful gathered “for the breaking of
bread.” (Acts 20:7) It was also the day when Paul restored the young man
Eutychus to life who fell asleep while listening to one of Paul’s hours long
sermon and tumbled to his death from a third story window where he was
sitting. (cf. Acts 20:8-12; DD 21) Besides being called the first day, Sunday is
also called “the eighth day.” The seventh day being the Sabbath, the next day,
Sunday, became the “eighth day.” It is an image of eternity when Christians
consider “the age to come,” eternal life. (cf. DD 26)
On Saturday night of Holy Week, the first part of the Easter Vigil is the
“Service of Light.” Fire is blessed and the Easter Candle, a symbol of Christ,
is lighted. Carried up the aisle in a darkened church, the priest/deacon lifts
high the candle and sings three times, Christ our Light. The people sing, Thanks
be to God. The candle symbolizes the light of early dawn on Easter Sunday
morning when Jesus, who said, “I am the Light of the world,” (Jn 9:5) rose
from the tomb.
Pentecost is holy and solemn because it was on Sunday, the first day of the
week, when Christ sent his Spirit. It is “remembered” because the Holy Spirit
came upon the Apostles and Mary gathered in the “upper room” (Acts 1:13) in
the form of “a mighty wind” and “fire.” (Acts 2:2-3) “Pentecost is the
founding day of the Church, the mystery which forever gives life to the
Church.” (cf. DD 28 ; John Paul II, Dominium et Vivificantem, The Holy Spirit
in the Life of the Church and the World, DeV, 22-26). Sunday is “the Day of
Faith.” In fact, “Sunday appears as the supreme day of faith.” By the power
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4925 **** -->of the Holy Spirit, (cf. DD 29) the Church “remembers” all the major events of
Christ’s life celebrating them through meaningful liturgies on Sundays. Christ
himself encourages us to believe and strengthens us against unbelief. Thus he
says to us what he said to the Apostle Thomas, “Blessed are those who have not
seen and have believed.” (Jn 20:29) In the Creed we publicly profess what we
believe, and with the help of God’s indispensable grace live what we believe.</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p35">
          <p>Sunday, Day of the Church, Dies Ecclesiae
4. a. Sunday is indeed the day when all the members of Christ’s mystical body
come together to celebrate “the living presence of the risen Lord in the midst
of his own people.” (DD 31) Baptized persons are not saved alone as
individuals, but as members of Christ’s Church. They come together to express
their identity with Christ and with each other. “The scattered children of
God” (Jn 11:52) reunite and become one in the Eucharist through the power of
the Holy Spirit. (cf. DD 31) The Church, therefore, is a “Eucharistic
assembly.” The assembly becomes “church,” ecclesia, because it is the
Eucharist, which forms and feeds the assembled Church. (cf. DD 32)
The Catechism of the Catholic Church states: “the Sunday celebration of the
Lord’s Day and his Eucharist is the heart of the Church’s life.” (CCC 2177)
Pastors, therefore, must stress that the Sunday Eucharist is a community
celebration. Vatican II’s Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy stated, “within
the parish a lively sense of community celebration of Sunday Mass” must “be
fostered in the thinking and practice of both laity and clergy.” (cf. DD 35; SC
42) Community celebration requires carrying it out reverently and exactly
according to liturgical norms, sustaining it and building it up by bringing to
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4950 **** -->and forming lapsed Catholics in Small Ecclesial Faith Communities in preparation
for incorporation into the Church. Essential to the Church’s Sunday assembly is
“the twofold table of the word and of the Bread of Life.”
The liturgical document of Vatican Council II noted, “The Liturgy of the Word
and the Liturgy of the Eucharist are so closely joined together that they form a
single act of worship.” (DD 39) By reading the sacred texts of God’s word “in
a spirit of prayer and docility” individuals and families can gain from them
great spiritual formation, and from the interpretation the Church gives
them. (cf. DD 40)</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p36">
          <p>b. The table of the Bread of Life is of course the Holy Eucharist. Sunday is the
day of thanksgiving for this gift. “The whole community gathers to celebrate
the ’Lord’s Day,’ the Eucharist … the great ’thanksgiving.”’ Each of the
Eucharistic prayers are the Church’s prayers of thanksgiving for the gift of
Christ in the Eucharist. The culmination of the Eucharistic prayer of
thanksgiving is expressed by the assembly by the “Great Amen,” meaning “so be
it;” It means giving affirmation, support, approval. Filled with the Spirit the
Church gives resounding, not weak, thanks to the Father through the Son in the
“Great Amen.” (cf. DD 42)
Why is the table of the Eucharist so special, precious and without equal? It is
the sacrifice of Jesus on the Cross re-presented on the altar. Christ not only
re-enacts his own sacrifice but also unites the sacrifice of the Church with his
own. (DD 43) The Body of Christ, the Church, participates in the offering of her
Head, the Lord. “In the Eucharist the sacrifice of Christ becomes also the
sacrifice of the members of his Body. The lives of the faithful, their praise,
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 4975 **** -->sufferings, prayer and work are united with those of Christ and with his total
offering, and so acquire a new value.” (CCC 1368) We bring our burdens to Jesus
and He makes them lighter, easier and holy. (cf. Mt 11:30)
In the very earliest times Sunday Eucharist was so deeply felt by Christians
that rather than miss Mass they were willing to suffer martyrdom. Many early
Christians were in fact martyred, under cruel emperors such as Diocletian,
Valerian, Hadrian and others. The catacombs and many churches in Rome and
elsewhere attest to it. (cf. DD 46) Only later due to weak faith or negligence
did the Church “make explicit the duty to attend Sunday Mass,” at first “in
the form of exhortation,” then by imposing “penalties.” Only in 1917 the Code
of Canon Law “gathered this tradition into a universal law,” saying that “on
Sundays and other holy days of obligation the faithful are bound to attend
Mass.” “This legislation has normally been understood as entailing a grave
obligation.” (cf. DD 47) “Those who deliberately fail in this obligation
commit grave sin.” (CCC 2181)</p>

          <p>Sunday, the Day of Man, Dies Hominis
5. The reason that Pope John Paul II gave for issuing his apostolic letter, Dies
Domini, The Day of the Lord, on the Solemnity of Pentecost Sunday, May 31, 1998
was to highlight the importance of observing the Day of the Lord, and also to
respect it as the Day of Man. Observance of Sunday gives Christians a unique
identity as the Pope stated. Himself a very human person and fully in touch with
human beings in every part of the world, he has characterized the Day of Man,
Sunday, in very human terms. He said man needs a day of joy, rest and solidarity
with fellow human beings.
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5000 **** -->These characterizations have a basis in the creation story in the Book of
Genesis, but they are in part original to him. On the seventh day God “rested
from all the work he had undertaken” (Gen 2:2) Implicit in “rest” is the
feeling of joy and the joy of rest is enhanced when shared with family, friends
and loved ones in togetherness, thus solidarity. (cf. CCC 2184) Drawn perhaps
from his almost four years of forced labor as a rock breaker in a limestone
quarry in Poland in summer heat and sub-zero winter weather during the Nazi
occupation in 1940, Karol Wojtyla, the future pope, knew how welcome a day of
rest was. Workers today look forward to Friday and the following two days of
freedom from work and business.
Unfortunately growing commercialization of Sundays is eroding the sanctification
of the Day of the Lord and the Day of Man. In early times of Christianity Sunday
was not a day set aside on the civic calendar. However, to experience the value
and sacredness of Sunday “Christians celebrated the weekly day of the risen
Lord primarily as a day of joy.” (DD 55) The Didascalia, a source book of
liturgical practice in the young Catholic Church in Northern Syria in the third
century, advised Christians: “On the first day of the week, you shall all
rejoice.” (cf. DD 55)</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p38">
          <p>The Day of Man is a Day of Rest and Joy
6. Before his passion Jesus forewarned his Apostles, “You will be sorrowful,
but your sorrow will turn into joy.” (Jn 16:20) Because Sunday Eucharist has a
festive character (example, it is appropriate to dress up to go to Mass) it
expresses joy. Christ communicates to his Church joy through the gift of the
Holy Spirit, and “joy is one of the fruits of the Holy Spirit.” (Rom 14:17;
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5025 **** -->also cf. DD 56) To complain that one gets bored at Mass is not to be open to the
Holy Spirit. Spiritual joy has distinctive qualities. It is not shallow; nor
does it just titillate the senses or excite the emotions. Rather Christian joy
is enduring. It consoles even when the soul is burdened or the body is
suffering. (cf. DD 57)
True Christian joy as distinguished from human joy comes from the heart of the
glorified Christ. Christian joy is the kind of joy the Apostles experienced on
seeing Christ on the evening of Easter. Thinking they were seeing a ghost, he
showed them his hands and feet. It was He! “They were incredulous for joy.”
(cf. Lk 24:37-41; DD 58) A similar Christian joy is witnessed in parishes when,
following Sunday Eucharist, members gather in joy in front of church to chat or
go to the parish hall for coffee to visit, meet and socialize with fellow
Catholics. Sunday Eucharist does give joy if we want it.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.Sx1.p39">
          <p>7. The Creator rested with joy, and “looked at everything he had made and found
it very good.” (Gen 1:31) Only in about the fifth century were work laws
finally relaxed in the Roman Empire, and rest became part of Sunday along with
joy and leisure. But in some countries hostile to Christianity, Christians
worship on Sunday when they can and often secretly. Sunday not being a public
day of rest, they are not free to keep Sunday “sacred” by going to Mass
openly. (cf. DD 64)
Similar situations exist in some under-developed countries where poor people
must work long hours in miserable work places, are exploited and their personal
dignity debased. Often they too are unable to participate in Sunday Eucharist
and are denied a much needed day of rest and joy. In his famed social
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5050 **** -->encyclical, Rerum Novarum issued in 1891, Pope Leo XIII stated emphatically that
workers have a right to Sunday rest and the state must guarantee it. (cf. DD 66)</p>

          <p>The Day of Man is also a Day of Solidarity
8. By this statement the Holy Father means that Sunday should also be a day of
fraternal, inter-personal sharing; a day when Christians have time and take time
to bond lovingly with others, show concern for them and bring solace to brothers
and sisters in bodily or spiritual need and care for them. Pope John Paul II put
it this way: “Sunday should also give the faithful an opportunity to devote
themselves to the works of mercy, charity and the apostolate.” (DD 69) In line
with Church tradition “works” can be “corporal” that is, giving material aid
to the poor. Example: “[F]raternal sharing with the very poor…” “the
collection organized for the poor churches in Judea.” (cf. DD 70) “Works”
refer no less to spiritual works of mercy. Such works palpitate the heart of the
giver and the heart of the one who receives.</p>

the aim and goal of the CLCC process. This means reaching out to others to bring
them to faith in God and to his Church. The Catechism’s full statement on
“missionary outreach” is the following: “The fidelity of the baptized is the
primordial condition for the proclamation of the Gospel and for the Church’s
mission in the world. In order that the message of salvation can show the power
of its truth and radiance before men, it must be authenticated by the witness of
the life of Christians.” “The witness of a Christian life and the good works
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5075 **** -->done in a supernatural spirit have great power to draw men to the faith and to
God.” (CCC 2044) More simply, the mission of Catholic faithful in the world is
to live the Christian life authentically and thereby draw men to faith and God

          <p>The Day of Solidarity and the Commandment to Love One Another
9. At the Last Supper in one of his two discourses to the Apostles Jesus said
passionately, “This is my commandment: love one another as I love you.” (Jn
15:12) Being a day of rest and joy, Sunday is also a day of solidarity with
other Christians, in particular the hungry and thirsty, the stranger, the naked,
the ill and those in prison. (cf. Mt 25:35-46) All such works are rooted in the
law of love, charity. But they are not limited to the above six works.
John Paul II speaks of “inventiveness of which Christian charity is capable.”
(DD 72) To increase solidarity among lapsed Catholics, Christian charity demands
that active Christians spend a few hours each week finding, contacting and
visiting non-practicing Catholics in their homes, introducing them to Christian
fellowship in Small Ecclesial Faith Communities in their parish, and experience
in them love and caring of Christians in true solidarity with one another. Most
importantly they will experience within SEFCs Christian solidarity when the tide
of God’s grace begins to flood their hearts.
Ultimate Christian solidarity takes place when they re-unite with Christ in the
Sunday Eucharist and receive him in Holy Communion. This work of mercy has no
equal. It is a merciful act of self-giving to a person in need of
salvation. What better way to love another than to help a disconnected fellow
Christian return to solidarity with Christ and to solidarity with his brothers
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5100 **** -->and sisters in the “Church of the Eucharist,” the Body of Christ!</p>

          <p>10. Millions of non-church-going Catholics are drowning in the floodwaters of
the secular and de-Christianized culture. They have cut themselves adrift from
the safe moorings of the Catholic Church to which they were once joined. Not a
few secretly worry about their religious state. They are hoping for a rescuer to
come along. Christians should make saving lapsed Catholics their chief work of
mercy. This brings about solidarity, the re-uniting and bonding of drifting
Catholics into the body of the Catholic Church. Jesus said to his Apostles. “I
will make you fishers of men.” (Mk 4:19) In an appearance to seven disciples
after his Resurrection who were fishing, Jesus shouted to them from the shore,
“Cast your net over the right side of the boat and you will find something,”
“Duc in altum.” They took in a huge catch of fish, one hundred and
fifty-three. (Jn 21:6,11) Christians and SEFC Home Visitors (cf. Stage 4),
should be “fishers of men!” Bring lapsed, lost and indifferent fellow
Catholics to the haven of the Catholic Church. Without doubt it is the most
urgent work of mercy and charity in the CLCC apostolate.
Yet another way to look at the Day of Solidarity is to hear this word spoken by
Jesus on the Cross, “I thirst.” (Jn 19:28) He thirsts for the salvation of all
because he died for all. As members of his Body, the Church, we are obliged to
satisfy his intense thirst. We do this by retrieving stray Catholics and
restoring them into the community of believers, koinonia, into solidarity with
him. In the words of St. Paul, achieving solidarity means “to equip the holy
ones for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all
attain to the unity of faith and knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood,
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5125 **** -->to the extent of the full stature of Christ.” (Eph 4:12-13) Paul’s words are in
part the inspiration of this process of in-depth faith formation and outreach to
the lapsed called Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian.
Summary
Stage 5 contains three parts. All parts are linked and the title of each part
immediately suggests its content. The Introduction establishes the fact that
Catholic believers are “Stewards of the Eucharist.” “Let everyone see us as
servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.” (1 Cor 4:1)</p>

This part establishes the great truth of faith that the Eucharist is Christ
himself, his body and blood, soul and divinity. St. Thomas Aquinas states “That
in this sacrament are the true Body of Christ and his true Blood is something
that ‘cannot be apprehended by the senses, but only by faith, which relies on
divine authority.”’ (CCC 1381) The Gift of the Eucharist is food, a spiritual
banquet. To receive Holy Communion is to take in and be nourished by Christ, the

Worship, as an act of religion; Transubstantiation; Signs of Adoration;
Celebration of believers and the Real Presence. The next seven aspects of
worship focus on Sunday, the Day of the Lord, the Day of Christ, and the Day of

“Let everyone see us as servants of Christ and stewards of the
mysteries of God.” (1 Cor 4:1)
1. This text from St. Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians is addressed first
to bishops. It includes clergy and the lay faithful. It’s a service
text. “Stewards” are service people to God’s people in need of the sacraments,
“the mysteries of God” and other works for growing in faith and
holiness. Imagine the millions of baptized Catholics who do not receive God’s
life-giving mysteries, some for many years. They are spiritually starved. Young
people and even children are hungry for the truth but do not know they hunger
for the “bread” which only God can give, not what their eyes see at the
shopping mall. As a “steward” of God’s mysteries, say to yourself: I can feed
them with loving concern for their salvation with truth about Jesus, and help
them come to him in his Church. Share the insights the Holy Spirit gives you..</p>

          <p>2. Do you have exposition of the Blessed Sacrament in your parish? How often,
once a month, daily, all night? Is public exposition just a beautifully
decorated altar with candles, flowers and lights? Does your priest invite people
to come daily to make an hour of adoration of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament?
Are there persons in your parish who have expressed interest in this public
devotion? As we have learned, isn’t the Holy Eucharist “the font and apex of
the whole Christian life?” (LG 11) Ask, how can we celebrate as Catholic
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5200 **** -->Christians if we don’t have a deep love of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament? What
can I/we do to get eucharistic adoration started if it isn’t started, or if
started to grow among believers? Share.</p>

stewards of this mystery,is the Real Presence of Jesus among us. The place he
has chosen to be among us apart from the Mass is in the tabernacle of our
churches. If we are persons of deep faith shouldn’t his presence prompt us to
visit him, to want to “see” him, to adore him, thank and praise him, and at
the same time express sorrow for our sins and ask him to help us love him more
and more? Reflect, how strong is my faith in his real presence? How deep is my
love of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament?</p>

Body and Blood are food and drink that nourish the souls of believers, and those
who reject this truth such as non-believers, skeptics, and even some dissenters
who choose only truths they like. We who believe in the great eucharistic
mystery feel an urge at times to speak to them, telling them what they are
depriving themselves of, and praying they will open their hearts to the gift of
faith in the Eucharist. Or, do we tend to “write them off” as hopeless
cases?. As good stewards of the Eucharist, reflect and ask the Lord what he

<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5225 **** -->stages of the CLCC process, reflect: do I have a much improved appreciation of
the Eucharistic Sacrifice of the Mass, that Jesus is indeed the “source and

teachings, biblical texts and quotations from distinguished teachers of the
faith through its 2000 year history. In this week’s formation session, open your
Catechism of the Catholic Church to article 3 on The Sacrament of the Eucharist,
pages 334-356. Browse through the sections to see how the sacred doctrine on
Eucharist is presented. Go through all pages. Select the section that catches

          <p>The Eucharist is God the Father’s supreme gift of his beloved Son to us
3. What is most important to remember about the Eucharist is that it is a
memorial, a sacred action which serves to perpetuate the memory of the
God-Christ re-enacting his Sacrifice on the Cross and becoming spiritual food
and drink to those who believe in him. A memorial can be a lifeless “thing”
like the beautiful memorial tomb of the Unknown Introduction.</p>

          <p>4. A conflict exists between those accepting humbly the great truth of Jesus
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5250 **** -->that his body and blood are food and drink which nourish the souls of believers,
and non-believers, skeptics and dissenters who question this truth or reject
it. Fortunately believing in this great Eucharistic mystery as we do, what does
this gift who is Christ impel us to do toward non-believers? Feel moved to tell
them about the great sacrament they are depriving Soldier in Arlington Cemetery
in Washington, D.C. But the Eucharist is a living memorial which helps us
remember Jesus’ death on the Cross and his resurrection from
death. Simultaneously the Eucharist is a remembering of the Last Supper when
Jesus changed bread and wine into his Body and Blood. The Mass is, therefore, a
memorial, the “remembering” of what Jesus did 2000 years ago. What he does
here and now, today and every day in Eucharistic celebrations is a
“remembering.” Reflect on the Eucharist as a memorial. Pray and
believe. Share.
We can study and reflect on the mystery of the Holy Eucharist as a memorial, as
sacrifice, as sacrament, and make progress in appreciating it, but we will not
fully understand it until we reach heaven and see Christ face to
face. “Remember” that Mass is a ’live’ re-presentation of Jesus’ suffering,
death on the Cross and resurrection from the dead enacted by Jesus himself
through the actions of the priest. Christ making himself really present in the
Mass is the incomparable gift he gives us. That he makes himself present to us
as sacrifice and sacrament at all times and places is the great Mystery of
Faith. This mystery requires your deepest and most loving reflection. Share.</p>

          <p>Absolutely central to the Holy Eucharist is its sacrificial meaning
5. The Mass is not only a ’live’ memorial, a remembering of Jesus’ Last Supper,
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5275 **** -->his Passion and Death and Resurrection, but the main event of Mass is his
sacrifice, a living re-enactment of his Suffering and Death on the Cross. He
makes present on the altar really and truly His broken and bruised body and his
blood that flowed from his wounds at the scourging and from his hands and feet
and side on the Cross. To be intimately united with him in his sacrifice, he
makes his body eatable and his blood drinkable. Reverently reflect on the

          <p>What about the “real presence?”
6. Having reflected on the Eucharist as memorial, as the Mystery of Faith, and
sacrifice, these sacred truths are expressed by a single phrase, the “real
presence.” This is the term that the Church uses for stating definitively that
Christ is really and truly present in the Eucharist. He is fully present, that
is substantially. What continues to appear as bread and wine is in reality his
body and blood, his soul and divine nature in the Eucharist. The truth of the
“real presence” is awesome. Again it demands our deepest reflection, and
prayer for faith. Share.</p>

        <para xml:id="Ch11.S1.p13">
          <p>Transubstantiation! What is it?
7. Transubstantiation, the conversion of bread and wine into the body and blood
of Christ, takes place through Jesus’ spoken words, “This is my Body” over
bread, and “This is my Blood” over a cup of wine. These are words that Jesus
spoke as God. They had the power to make change at the Last Supper. They
continue to have the power to make change now. The priest at Mass vocalizes
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5300 **** -->Jesus’ words. The ultimate Mystery of Faith is to accept the unfathomable
mystery of Transubstantiation. Reflect and pray: Lord, “I do believe, help my
unbelief.” (cf. Mk 9:24)
The next Mystery of Faith, Communion
8. The last Mystery of Faith is that the Eucharist is a banquet, a festive meal
of believers coming together in celebration. Recall that Jesus had no problem of
eating and drinking with sinners, multiplying loaves and fishes for thousands
and changing water into wine at the marriage feast in Cana. The “banquet”
words of Jesus at the Last Supper were “take and eat…” handing his Body
appearing as bread to his apostles. He then said “take this and drink…”
handing his Blood appearing to be a cup of wine to his apostles. The banquet is
communion, the many sharing one and same food and drink. Eucharistic communion
is more than nourishment that enhances union with Christ only the
individual. The Eucharistic banquet “binds us to the Lord, and in that way,
binds us to one another.” (Cardinal Ratzinger addressing John Paul II and the
College of Cardinals on the Holy Father’s 25th anniversary of his pontificate,
October, 2003) The eucharistic banquet forgives venial sin, helps us avoid sin
and grow in holiness. Indeed the Eucharist is God’s greatest gift to us. Reflect
and share.</p>

          <p>B. Stewardship of the Eucharist
Responsibility to oneself
1. To be a good steward means to be a responsible person. Privileged as we are
to be given the Holy Eucharist, certain responsibilities go with
privilege. Among the responsibilities given in par. 1, choose one, perhaps two,
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5325 **** -->which you recognize in yourself as needing improvement. Example. If you receive
Holy Communion often, perhaps daily, ask yourself, has it become routine, do I
make a conscious effort to realize what I am doing, am I reverent and filled
with faith, do I make a heartfelt thanksgiving? Reflect.</p>
        </para>
        <para xml:id="Ch11.S1.p15">
          <p>Responsibility to others
2. Recall from an earlier formation session (A.8.) that receiving the Eucharist
is not an individualistic action of a person but a communal action of many
persons in celebration of their faith. The very term “Holy Communion”
indicates that the community of believers comes together at the table of the
Lord to partake of his Body and Blood as food and drink. Sadly not all Catholics
receive Holy Communion, some for serious reasons. Millions of Catholics,
especially the lapsed, do not know what they are missing, that they are
depriving themselves deliberately of union with the Lord. Responsible stewards
of the Eucharist are obliged to help them return to the Lord. Reflect on this
duty. Share.
3. Jesus’ “washing the feet” of the apostles was not only a humble action of
charitable service (stewardship) but is also a powerful symbol to us for doing
good to others. Hundreds of Catholics are out of the Church in your parish, your
family, neighborhood and place of work. They are in need of symbolic
“washing,” a cleansing from sin, a change of lifestyle, formation in Catholic
values and return to the Eucharist. Resolve to bring at least one of these
people in need of “washing” into your SEFC. Help them to get back on the road
to Christ. Reflect. Pray for God’s grace to do this soon. Share.</p>

          <p>4. The causes for low Mass attendance are many. More could be added to the list
given here, for example the sex explosion now more explicit than ever imagined
brings untold moral and spiritual degradation to souls. But deficient
catechetical formation in one’s youth is the top culprit. This is why weekly
CLCC adult formation sessions provided in SEFCs bring about lifestyle changes
not believed to be achievable. In liturgy numerous instructions, directives,
admonitions and need for correction of liturgical abuses have been issued by the
Vatican in recent years in order to cultivate reverence, a sense of the
transcendent and safeguard the mystery of worship of the Triune God especially
the Eucharist. The CLCC process can and does produce change for the
better. Reflect on what you are expected to do in your SEFC to bring about this
change. Share.</p>

          <p>5. Ask yourself, to trivialize the Mass, the Eucharist, by injecting comedy into
it; will this bring a sense of the sacred into the celebration? Aren’t children
awed by mystery, the unseen but real, rather than by jokes and showmanship? In
short, Mass must become a holy experience as it is meant to be by Christ and his
Church. Pray that Mass in your parish and all parishes is a prayerful event. If
it is truly prayerful it will be joyous, be assured. All of us have attended a
Mass or been to a church where something was said or done which made us say,
“This isn’t right. It’s out of line. I’ve never seen or heard anything like
that before.” Without getting specific, Pope John Paul II has called these
novelties “shadows” which blur the beauty and “lights” of the
liturgy. Cardinal Arinze calls this “horizontalism” where the celebrant and
people stay on the level of themselves, when in fact the Mass is and should be
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5375 **** -->“perpendicular,” a celebration pointing up from earth to the glory of the
Father with the Son through the Holy Spirit. Reverence in the Mass cannot be
stressed enough. Reflect on how liturgical abuses can be corrected. Share. In
the Spirit keep discussion charitable.</p>

today? “Any thing goes,” “No one is going to tell me what to do,” “nobody
is going to go to hell anyway” “I’ll live my life the way I want.” These
expressions describe mildly the attitudes millions of people have about
freedom. What can be done? Certainly don’t give up. With grace from God and the
gift of fortitude from the Holy Spirit, our responsible stewardship toward them
is this: we must pray, discreetly advise, point out misconduct, teach Christian
behavior [the Ten Commandments], insist that solid truths be preached in church,
not get discouraged, be patient and live in strong hope that the light of God
will overcome their darkness. Believe that Christ wants everyone to be
saved. Trust the Holy Spirit to do the rest for his Church. Reflect and share.</p>

be disastrous to a person for his salvation on the one hand, and on the other
hand they compromise one’s own religious convictions or show indulgence to
another’s error thus giving scandal. In either case it is an assault on the
truth of Christ’s words at the consecration when he said that his blood is shed
“so that sins may be forgiven.” Resolve not to be influenced by passing
fallacies or be taken in by political correctness. Tolerance of sin contradicts
true charity. Let us be firm in our belief in the reality of sin, mortal and

          <p>8. The sacred institution of marriage was initiated by God when at the beginning
he created man and woman. He made man first (Gen 2:7). Feeling alone, God
created for the first man a “suitable partner” (cf. Gen 2:20) and called her
“woman,” and “the two of them became one.” (cf. Gen 2:23-24) “God blessed
them, saying ’Be fertile and multiply.”’ (Gen 1:28) Down through the centuries
every society has understood that the purpose of marriage was the “begetting
and education of children, and secondly mutual help.” Do you see why the vast
majority of people are opposed to same-sex unions and angry at federal courts
for legalizing them in certain states? This is a frontal attack on marriage, the
foundation of society, on the family, the fundamental unit of society, and the
two-parent home for having and raising children. No nation or society can
survive that approves as normal same-sex partnerships. As responsible stewards,
reflect on ways you can help persons with this disordered orientation to live
chaste and holy lives. Share.</p>

socials, talk is usually about the weather, sports and children. When
conversation drifts into politics or religion often strong opinions are
expressed. Some statements might be objectively true. Others might be “off the
wall.” “Off the wall” opinions are given often when religion is discussed in
a mixed group of solid, orthodox Catholics and liberal, dissenting Catholics,
also among Catholics and non-Catholics. When discussion gets animated, usually
someone will say in an appeasing voice, “But all religions are the same; we all
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5425 **** -->believe in the same God, lead a good life and we’ll all go to heaven.”
Not so! This is what Dominus Iesus, the Declaration of the Congregation on the
Doctrine of the Faith, 2000 stated: salvation is for all but only in Christ and
in his Church. St. Peter said it concisely and perfectly: “There is no
salvation through anyone else, nor is there any other name under heaven given to
the human race by which we are to be saved.”(cf. Acts 4:12) Reflect on
St. Peter’s statement. Religions are not relative nor all the same .For all its

buttoned issues? As a Catholic striving for holiness and doing outreach to
Catholics outside of the Church, do I firmly accept the Church’s and the Popes’
teachings on so-called “controversial issues?” Do I question, doubt or reject
the Church’s teaching authority on issues I don’t like? Am I willing to change

          <p>C. Eucharist and Catholic Worship
1. As a way to prepare for and appreciate receiving Holy Communion as worthily
and fruitfully as possible, it is necessary that we be conscious of no serious
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5450 **** -->sin and at the same time feel confident we are in the state of grace. To make
sure we are in the state of grace at all times, Christ gave us the sacrament of
Penance and Reconciliation. This is his loving gift to us, the powerful means
whereby through confession and sorrow (contrition) sins are forgiven, grace is
restored in our soul, the wounds of “ecclesial communion” healed, and the road
to holiness is opened. What frequent confession does for us for advancing in the
holiness is inestimable.
The good example of going to the Sacrament of Penance frequently which members
of SEFCs give to returnees in the group is also inestimable. This example shows
returnees that practicing Catholics really “practice” their faith. Observing
this practice impacts favorably on their desire to return to the
Church. Reflect: do I receive this Sacrament frequently; am I a good example?</p>

          <p>2. Worship of God according to the clear statement of the First Commandment is
neither an option nor a personal preference. The true God is to be adored as the
one and only God. To dare to choose another way is to worship a “strange”
god. Reflect deeply on how the devil, the Evil One, used “choice” on Jesus on
the mountain top, on the pinnacle of the temple and in Gethsemani to worship him
rather than the Father. Imagine a fallen angel who wanted to be God still
pursues that end, tempting even Christ to worship him and the world he
rules. None of us are immune from encountering this kind of temptation. Jesus’
answer to the devil must be our answer, “Be gone, Satan.” Share.</p>

3. Note the clear and concise description of adoration in relation to worship as
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5475 **** -->given in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2000. The central words are “to
acknowledge” God as Lord and “to thank” him for his love. In adoration note
also the importance of “respect and submission” that we should give to God,
acknowledging our “nothingness” without him, our need, therefore, to praise
and exalt him, and reject temptations to self-importance and
vainglory. Reflecting on these aspects, would you say, in brief, that adoration
is humble prayer to our Almighty and loving God? Share.</p>

          <p>4. The highest form of worship that we are to give to God is of course to the
Holy Eucharist, where Christ, according to the will of the Father, and the
intervention of the Holy Spirit, makes himself present to his people under the
“signs” of bread and wine. By means of the Eucharist Jesus Christ himself
becomes the “source and summit of the Christian life” (LG 11). This process,
Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian, is a preparation for and leads up to a
faith-filled action of extolling and honoring the God-Man, Christ, for his
monumental sacrifice on the Cross re-enacted through ritual of the Mass. The
Eucharist is the “sublime cause” that unites God with the worldwide community
of faith-persons called the Church. Reflect how we are a part of it requiring
our grateful worship of praise and thanks. Share.</p>

          <p>5. Outward signs of adoration of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament within Mass and
outside of Mass are not only appropriate but required. On entering and leaving
church for example, the genuflection or profound bow are customary reverential
gestures due to the Lord who is present in the sacrament. In some parishes
genuflections are almost a thing of the past. Also signing oneself with holy
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5500 **** -->water on entering and leaving church. Lost in great part is silence in church
even during Mass. Loud talking in church after Mass is becoming commonplace even
in parishes where the tabernacle is visible and occupies a prominent place in
the sanctuary. Loud talking distracts parishioners who try to pray after Mass in
quiet. Reflect: while in church do I give appropriate outward signs of adoration
to the Blessed Sacrament?</p>

sentence taken from the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (SC 7) affirms this
truth. Why this emphasis? So that it is not forgotten that the central and
primary focus of the Eucharistic liturgy is Jesus, not on the celebrant and not
on the assembly. It is on Jesus Christ, the sacrificial victim, in unity with
the Holy Spirit who re-enacts his passion, death and resurrection to the glory
of the Father. It is God who is worshiped, no one else. Do you consciously try
to give your fullest attention to Jesus, the Redeemer, when you participate in
the Eucharistic worship? In quiet reflect. Share.</p>

Sunday, the Day of the Lord
1. and 2. The third commandment is stated simply: Remember to keep holy the
Lord’s Day. For us Christians the Lord’s Day is a day of rest. After six days of
creating the universe, God “gazed” on his creation and saw that it was “very
good.” (Gen 1:31) It was the seventh day and God blessed it making it “holy.”
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5525 **** -->How is it made holy? Not because God set it aside as a “day of rest,” but it
became a day for “remembering” creation (“gazing”), a day for
“remembering” deliverance exemplified in the Exodus, and for “remembering”
the day when Jesus rose from the dead.
These monumental events in the mystery of the God’s relationship with man demand
“remembering.” They make the day “holy.” On the Lord’s Day, our “gaze”
should be on these events. What does “gaze” mean to you? On what do you
“gaze” at Mass? Reflect. Share.</p>

tomb early Sunday morning he became Christ our Light in darkness. On Pentecost
Sunday Christ showed himself brilliantly as “the light of the world” when he

4. a. Nothing gives stronger witness to the Church than when “the Church”
assembles on Sunday, the Lord’s Day, for Eucharistic worship. Worship is a
community celebration when the baptized faithful gather at the table of the
word, the readings, and at the table of the Bread of Life, where Christ makes
his Body and Blood spiritual food and drink for his body, the Church. The
Eucharistic prayer is a prayer of thanksgiving. At the “Great Amen” the
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5550 **** -->assembly affirms aloud that Christ’s in unity with the Holy Spirit gives his
Almighty Father “all glory and honor.” At the same time the Eucharistic
sacrifice of Christ unites all the praises, prayers, sufferings and works of the
members of his Church in total offering to the Father. Do you see why Sunday is
the Day of the Church, the celebration of “the living presence of the risen
Lord in the midst of his own people?” Give the Lord humble and profound thanks

excuse themselves from accepting it. Do you see why the Church legislates that
to casually skip Sunday Mass is a mortal sin against God’s first commandment?

Day of Man as Pope John Paul II has stated. Being a very human person he affirms
Sunday in terms of joy, rest and solidarity. His observation is not entirely his
own. God “rested from all the work he had undertaken.” (Gen 2:2) Rest is
refreshing. It restores a feeling of joy to be with family and friends. Reflect
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5575 **** -->that in early Christianity Sunday was not a civic day free from

words in the title: Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian. A key dynamic of

smile crosses your face and already the good feeling of being able to do “your

feeling of a two-day weekend for everyone. Some people must work on weekends by
virtue of the kind of job they have such as firemen and policemen, nurses, cooks
and waitresses and others.
That we have a five-day work week and a two-day weekend plus a day or two more
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5600 **** -->for observing certain holidays, we can thank greatly Pope Leo XIII. Early in the
20th century he announced to leaders in the work world and in state government
to give their workers a day of rest and joy, and from the Church’s perspective
this would allow workers to give worship and thanksgiving to the Lord by coming
to and participating in Sunday Mass. They listened but not without
struggle. This calls for us to reflect on the blessing we have of a free
weekend. Thank the Lord and the Church for obtaining this “right” to rest and

solidarity is not limited these actions. Solidarity includes making connection
with lapsed Catholics, finding the lost, reaching out to the wayward and
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 5625 **** -->bringing hope to the despairing and rejected. Solidarity means not resting until
every lapsed Catholic living in the parish boundaries is brought into the loving
center of a SEFC where he begins his return to Christ and the Church by grace of
the Holy Spirit. Doing this is the acid test of the commandment: “love one

“I have come for the salvation of all.” I will make you “fishers of men.”
(Mt 4:19; Mk 1:17) Indeed, members of SEFCs, committed to bring into the Church
all lapsed, lost and indifferent Catholics, are indeed “fishers of men” of
whom Christ spoke. They cast the nets of the CLCC conversion process not on the
surface but into the deep where fishing is not easy. Apply Jesus’ analogy to
yourself. I too am a fisher of men. I am also called to satisfy Jesus’ immense
“thirst” for souls that he expressed on the Cross. I/we satisfy his thirst by
seeking out non-practicing Catholics, and with the Lord’s grace we bring them
into the community of believers in order to build up the Body of Christ to
“full stature.” Pray and say to the Lord, I want to be a holy disciple and an

different way. It is precisely for this reason that Peter called Christians ”a

one was able to hear in his own language. Moreover, the Good News of the kingdom

are not first of all new person renewed by Baptism, and by lives lived according
to the Gospel. The purpose of Evangelization is precisely this interior change,
and the best way of stating this is: the Church evangelizes when she seeks to
convert the consciences of people through the divine power of the word she
proclaims, through the activities in which they engage and in the milieu in

complex process [emphasis added] and is made up of varied elements: the renewal
of humanity, witness, explicit proclamation, interior adherence (formation),
entry into the community, acceptance of signs and apostolic initiatives. These
elements may seem contradictory, one in competition with another. But they are

to man and his real problems, his hopes and sufferings, his achievements and
falls-this too also makes the Church as a body, an organism, a social unit

Spouse and Lord. Indeed, precisely because Christ united himself with her in his
mystery of Redemption, the Church must be strongly united with each man.

        <p>21. The Christian Vocation to Service and Kingship! In building up from the very
foundations the picture of the Church as the People of God - the Second Vatican
Council highlighted, among other characteristics of the Christian vocation, the
one that can be described as “kingly.” One element seems to stand out: the
sharing in Christ’s kingly mission, that is to say the fact of rediscovering in
oneself and others the special dignity of our vocation that can be described as
“kingship.” This dignity is expressed in readiness to serve in keeping with
the example of Christ who “came not to be served but to serve.” Christ “being
a king” is truly possible for us only by “being a servant,” and “being a
servant” also demands great spiritual maturity. In order to be able to serve
others worthily and effectively we must be able to master ourselves, seeking to
possess the virtues that make mastery possible.

Father and Lord, in his goodness and mercy. As we enter the third millennium of

traditionally Christian world, people are gradually drawing closer to Gospel
ideals and values, a development which the church seeks to encourage. Today
there is a new consensus among peoples about these values: the rejection of

and material. Indeed, a true Christian community is also committed to
distributing earthly goods so that no one is in want. The first communities were

an “unspeakable crime.” But today, in many people’s consciences the perception
of its gravity has become progressively obscured. The acceptance of abortion in
the popular mind, in behavior and even in law, is a telling sign of an extremely
dangerous crisis in the moral sense, which is becoming more and more incapable
of distinguishing between good and evil, even when the fundamental right of life
is at stake.
“Procured abortion is the deliberate and direct killing, by whatever means it
is carried out, of a human being in the initial phase of his or her existence,
extending from conception to birth.” “The unborn child is totally entrusted to
the protection and care of the woman carrying him or her in the womb. And yet
sometimes it is precisely the mother herself who makes the decision and asks for
the child to be eliminated, and who then goes about having it done.” Among all
the crimes which can be committed against life, procured abortion has

family. Vatican Council II adopted the phrase, “domestic church,” so that it
will always remain in peoples’ minds. (cf. LG 11) Many “domestic churches” are
in difficulty or danger, are experiencing division, losing confidence, or are in
situations which the church describes as “irregular.” Unfortunately various
programs backed by very powerful resources (e.g. Planned Parenthood) seem
nowadays to aim at the breakdown of the family. In many instances “irregular
situations” are glamorized, made to look normal and attractive, but which in
fact contradict “truth and love.” They cause “tensions and divisions in
families, have ”grave consequences particularly for children.“ ”The moral
conscience becomes darkened; what is true, good and beautiful is deformed; and
freedom is replaced by what is actually enslavement.“ Love of truth comes from

        <p>The Sincere Gift of Self
11. ”Love causes man to find fulfillment through the sincere gift of self. To
love means to give and to receive something which can be neither bought nor
sold, but only given freely and mutually.“ ”The indissolubility of marriage
flows from the very essence of that gift: the gift of one person to another
person.“ When a man and woman ”transmit life to a child, a new human thou
becomes a part of the horizon of the we of the spouses, a person whom they will
call by a name: ’our son’; ’our daughter.’ “I have begotten a man with the help
of the Lord.” (Gen 4:1) says Eve.
Is a child a gift? “Is it really true that the new human being is a gift for
his parents? A gift for society?” “Apparently nothing seems to indicate
this. On occasion the birth of a child appears to be a simple statistical fact
registered in a demographic record. For the parents the birth of a child means
more work, new financial burdens and inconveniences, all of which can lead to
the temptation not to want another birth. In some social and cultural contexts
this temptation can become very strong. Does this mean that a child is not a
gift? That it comes into the world only to take and not to give? These are some
of the disturbing questions which men and women today find hard to escape. A
child comes to take up room when it seems that there is less and less room in
the world. But is it really true that a child brings nothing to the family and
society? Is not every child a ”particle“ of that common good without which
human communities break down and risk extinction? A child is a gift to his
parents, to his brothers and sisters and to society. The truth is obvious. ”The
common good of the whole of society dwells in man; he is, as we recalled, ’the
way of the Church.’“ ”Man is first of all the ’glory of God.’“

        <p>Opposed to the civilization of love, to the family, the fundamental cell of
society, is ”the possibility of a destructive ’anti-civilization.“’ It appears
as a ”crisis of truth“ which is a crisis of concepts, the distortion of words
like love, freedom, sincere gift, persons, rights, marriage and
family. Contemporary civilization is linked to science and progress in
technology which is positivistic. Positivism results in agnosticism in theory
and utilitarianism in practice and ethics. Utilitarianism is a civilization of
production and of use, a civilization of things and not of persons, a
civilization in which persons are used in the same way as things are used. In
the civilization of use, woman can become an object for man, children a
hindrance to parents, the family an institution obstructing the freedom of its
members. Destructive ”anti-civilization“ is responsible for certain liberal
sexual education programs, pro-abortion tendencies and the so-called ”right to
choose,“ safe sex, anti-birth mentality, consumerism, selfishness, loss of
truth, loss of love, concupiscence, man’s and woman’s ”use“ of each other,
slavery to weakness and defenselessness against these evils. Joy is the mark of

existence in a particular family, nation and culture … they are your first

one’s father and the person of one’s mother. ”Honor is essentially an attitude
of unselfishness.“ Honor one’s father and mother demands ”concern for the good
of the family.“ ”For this reason it makes demands of the parents themselves.“
”You parents, the divine precept seems to say, should act in such a way that
your life will merit the honor (and the love) of your children.“ ”Ultimately

willingness to take his own part in the first stage of the gift of humanity, and
to become willingly involved as a husband and father in the motherhood of his
wife. Education is before all else a reciprocal “offering” on the part of both
parents: together they communicate their own mature humanity to the newborn
child, who gives them in turn the newness and freshness of the humanity which it
has brought into the world. This is the case even when children are born with
mental and physical disabilities. Here, the situation of the children can

Religious education and the catechesis of children make the family a true

family is a “sovereignty society” with “family rights”. In 1983 the Holy See

the pew, or are timid about addressing the birth control issue because it is
“controversial,” or fear that parishioners who disagree with him will go to
another church for Mass or quit going to Mass altogether. However, many priests
seem to forget that perhaps the majority of worshipers at Mass are in agreement
with him and support him on this issue. Thus, clerical silence is a major cause,
though not the only cause, why the incidence of contracepting Catholic couples

        <p>1. The heart of authentic religious faith, both Jewish and Christian, lies in
the Lord’s command to love him with one’s whole heart, soul, mind and strength
(Deut 6:4-5). To this commandment Jesus added a second, “you shall love your
neighbor as yourself, (Lev 19:18; Mk 12:29-31) He made the two commandments
one. How can we keep these two precepts? (1 Jn 4:10) God first loved us. He
created us and in creating us he gave himself to us as a gift to love him in

is our response to his love. We are expected and obliged, therefore, to return
God’s love to God because God is Love.

united as an expression of God’s love, and (2) How the Church responds to God’s
love in a ”community of love.“ Love, A problem of Language! Love is a
universal word that has a variety of meanings and usages. For example, we speak
of love of country, love of one’s family, one’s profession, one’s work; also
love between friends, between man and woman, parents and children, and certainly
love of neighbor and love of God. However, ”one stands out, love between man
and woman, where body and soul are inseparably joined and human beings get a
glimpse of an apparently irresistible promise of happiness. This would seem to
be the very epitome of love.“

3. 4. 5. 6. In Sacred Scripture only three words, all Greek, denote love: eros
and philia meaning the love of friendship in pagan culture, and agape, ”the
Christian understanding of love.“ Over time eros has gone through many
interpretations, for example exaltation and sublimation of the human body as in
conjugal love that ”seeks only the good of the beloved, and is willing to make
sacrifice.“ The other side of eros is debasement, dehumanization and
exploitation of a human person. The ascent to ”ecstasy“ for the Divine ends in
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 6750 **** -->a fall, a degradation of man.”

        <p>7. The two fundamental words of love can be distinguished in this way: eros is a
term that indicates “worldly” love; agape refers to love grounded in and
shaped by faith. The two notions are often contrasted as “ascending” love,
possessive love, and “descending” love, oblative love which means self-giving
love. Although ascending love and descending love seem to be opposites, they
“can never be completely separated.” They have “a proper unity in the reality
of love.”</p>

        <p>In the account of Jacob’s ladder, the Fathers of the Church saw it, presents a
biblical image of ascending and descending love as having an “inseparable
connection,” “between eros which seeks God and agape which passes on the gift
in various ways.” Examples of this connection are Moses, who entered into the
sacred presence of God at the “burning bush” and on Mt. Sinai (ascending love)
and emerged energized to “be of service to his people” (descending love); and
Paul, lifted into a mystical vision to see and understand “the most exalted
mysteries of God (ascending love) and afterward ”he was able to become all
things to all men“ (descending love) (cf. Gen 28:12; Jn 1:5).

in fact ”a single reality, but with different dimensions,“ and at times ”one
or the other dimension may emerge more clearly.“

        <p>The one, true God is identified and called the God of love. (1 Jn 4:8) Because
God created man out of his love, and ”this God loves man,“ his love is
”ascending.“ God came as Man to bring ”healing [to] the whole human
race. This is his “ascending” love. Indeed God loves, “and his love may
certainly be called eros, yet it is also totally agape, ”descending“ love
toward all mankind. Acknowledging that the God of love has two dimensions, eros
and agape, is our ”path“ towards love. ”[T]he ’Yes’ of our will to his will
unites our intellect, will and sentiments in the all-embracing act of love.“
The most perfect example of God’s double-dimensional love is in the institution
of the Eucharist at the Last Supper. It is at once ascending, possessive love,
eros, ”Jesus’ self-gift, sharing his body and blood“ on the cross and in his
real presence and real food, and at the same time it is descending love, agape,
”God’s condescension toward us“ ”to lift us to far greater heights than
anything that any human mystical elevation could ever accomplish.“

        <p>16. To the first commandment to love God totally, Jesus added a second
commandment, ”You shall love your neighbor as yourself.“ (cf. Mk 12:31) Can
love be commanded? St. John addresses this question: ”If anyone says, ’I love
God,’ and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother
whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.“ (1 Jn 4:20) How are
St. John’s words interpreted? ”St. John’s words are interpreted to mean that
love of neighbor is a path [emphasis added] that leads to an encounter with God,
and that closing our eyes to our neighbor blinds us to God.“

        <p>18. Love of neighbor is thus shown to be possible in the way proclaimed by the
Bible. This means if we are ”in God and with God“ we can love our neighbor and
even the one we do not know. This can be done not through our eyes and feelings,
but from the perspective of Jesus Christ. My neighbor, whoever he is, is
Christ’s friend, therefore he must be my friend. Every person has ”an interior
desire for a sign of love.“ I can give them the look of love which they crave,
only by ”seeing them with the eyes of Christ.“To avoid or have no contact with
”certain neighbors“ makes our relationship with them ”grow arid.“ When I
love and serve my neighbor my eyes can be opened to what God does for me and how
much he loves me. Thus, love of God and love of neighbor are inseparable. They
form a single commandment. Both come ”from the love of God who has loved us
first.“ Love of God and love of neighbor is not a case of a commandment
”imposed“ on us. Rather ”love is a freely bestowed experience of love from
within, which by its very nature must be shared. “Love grows through love.”
Love is “divine” because it comes from God and unites us to God; through this
unifying process it makes us a “we” that transcends our divisions and makes us
one, until in the end God is “all in all.” (1 Cor 15,28)

        <p>19. Saint Augustine wrote, “If you see charity, you see the Trinity.” In his
plan the Father sent his Son, the “Pierced One,” who died on the cross. Jesus
“gave up his Spirit” in anticipation of his sending the Holy Spirit after the
Resurrection, fulfilling the promise that “rivers of living water” would flow
into and out of the hearts of believers through the outpouring of the Holy
Spirit. (cf. Jn 7:38-39) The Holy Spirit is that interior power that harmonizes
Christ’s heart with believers’ hearts in order to move them to love their
brethren as Christ loved them. He washed their feet (cf. Jn 13:1-13), and gave
his life on the cross. (cf. Jn 1; 15:3)</p>

        <p>The Spirit is also the energy which transforms the heart of the ecclesial
community, so that it becomes a witness to the Father in the world, and in the
Son makes humanity a single family. The entire activity of the Church is an
expression of a love that seeks the integral good of man: through evangelization
by Word and Sacrament and the promotion of man in the various arenas of life,
and in the service of charity the Church carries out in an effort to alleviate
man’s sufferings, including his human needs.

        <p>20. Love of neighbor, grounded in the love of God, is a responsibility for each
individual member of the faith, but also for the entire ecclesial community, the
local particular Church and the Church Universal. As a community the Church must
practice love. It needs to be organized to carry out “ordered service” to the
community. The Church from the beginning was singular for its ordered service:
“All who believed were together and had all things in common; and they sold
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 6850 **** -->their possessions and goods and distributed them to all, as any had need.”
(Acts 2:44-45)
As the Church grew this radical form of material communion could not be
preserved. But its essential core remained: within the community of believers
there can never be room for a poverty that denies anyone what is needed for a
dignified life. To free the Apostles to celebrate the Eucharist, other liturgies
and the “ministry of the word,” deacons were selected to carry out the
“ministry of charity exercised in a communitarian orderly way.” They became
part of the fundamental structure of the Church.

        <p>39. Faith, hope and charity go together. Hope is practiced through the virtue of
patience even in the face of failure, and through the virtue of humility, hope
accepts God’s mystery, and trusts even in times of darkness. Faith tells us that
God has given his Son for our sakes, telling us that it is really true: God is
love. In spite of all darkness he ultimately triumphs in glory as the last part
of the Book of Revelation states. Faith, which sees the love of God revealed in
the pierced heart of Jesus on the Cross, gives rise to love. Love is the light
and in the end the only light that can always illuminate a world grown dim, and
gives us courage to keep living and working. Love is possible, and we are able
to practice it because we are created in the image of God who is Love.

        <p>1. The full title of this encyclical in Latin is “SPE SALVI facti sumus” - in
hope we were saved - words of St. Paul to the Romans, and likewise to us (Rom
8:24). According to the Christian faith, “redemption” is not a given and nor
is salvation. Redemption is offered to us in the context of hope, trustworthy
hope, enabling us to face our present, even if it is arduous; that the present
can be lived and accepted if it leads toward a goal, a sure goal, and if this
goal is great enough to justify the effort of the journey.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch21.p4">
        <p>2. The great question: on the basis of hope alone are we redeemed? “Hope” is a
keyword in biblical faith so much so that in several passages the words
“faith” and “hope” seem interchangeable. In his letter to the Hebrews
St. Paul links closely the “fullness of faith” (Heb 10:22) to “the confession
of our hope without wavering.” (Heb 10:23) In his first letter, St. Peter shows
this linkage when he encouraged new convert Christians to be strong in the face
of persecution: “sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts. Always be ready to
give an explanation to anyone who asks you for a reason for your hope.”
[emphasis added] (cf. 1 Pet 3:15-17) Thus, “hope” is equivalent to “faith.”
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 6900 **** -->Paul reminds the Ephesians that before their encounter with Christ they were
“without hope and without God in the world.” (Eph 2:12) St. Paul admonishes
the Thessalonians, you must not “grieve as others do who have no hope.” (1
Thes 4:13) A distinguishing mark of Christians is the fact that they have a
future, and believe in a future. They don’t know what awaits them, that is, the
details, but they believe and know in general terms that their life will not end
in emptiness. Indeed Christianity is “good news.” At one and the same time it
communicates “unknown content” and content “that can be known,” “that makes
things happen and is life-changing.” “The one who has hope lives differently;
the one who hopes has been granted the gift of a new life.”

      <para xml:id="Ch21.p5">
        <p>7. The link between faith and hope is shown by St. Paul in the lean definitions
he gives to the two gifts as found in the first line of his letter to the
Hebrews: “Faith is the realization of what is hoped for and evidence of things
not seen.” (Heb 11:1) Said another way: “Faith is the way of holding onto what
we hope for, and being certain of what we cannot see.” (Christian Community
Bible, 6th ed is something that is already present, for example the place we are
to go to. The reality of that place that will become known to us creates in us a
certainty: it is not yet visible, but the fact that that place, “thing,” is
real we carry within us a certain perception of it, that now comes into
existence. (This is a summary of Pope Benedict’s philosophical reasoning in his
effort to explain St. Paul’s text, Heb 11:1)

        <p>10. So now we must ask explicitly, is the Christian faith for us today a
life-changing and life-sustaining hope? [emphasis added] Recall the dialogue
used at the reception of an infant into the communion of believers in the Rite
of Baptism! The priest asks the parents on behalf of the child: “What do you
ask of the Church?” Answer: “Faith.” “And what does faith give you?”
“Eternal life!” Today, as in the past, this is what being baptized, becoming a
Christian is about. It is not an act of socialization within the community, nor
a ritual of welcome into the Church.
The parents expect more for their baptized child, not only incorporation into
the Church and a right to receiving the sacraments, but also and most
importantly eternal life. “Faith is the substance of hope.” Do people find
the prospect of eternal life attractive? Yes, if it is good on earth. But it is
temporary, and in fact an “impediment” to faith in eternal life. “To continue
living for ever endlessly appears more like a curse than a gift.” St. Ambrose
in his homily at his brother’s funeral put it this way: “Without the assistance
of grace, immortality is more of a burden than a blessing,” and concluded,
“Death is, then, no cause for mourning, for it is the cause of mankind’s
salvation.”

        <p>13 and 14. The intriguing phrase, “knowing without knowing” has been used a
long time to express the mystery of faith and its relationship to
hope. “Knowing” relates to what we know and believe by faith such as the
articles of faith in the Creed. “Without knowing” refers to hope, anticipation
of life after death, that reality totally unknown to us in this life. Henri de
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 6950 **** -->Lubac, the great French theologian, weighed in on the meaning of this unclear
phrase. He did not deny that salvation is “individualistic,” in the sense that
each person is saved as an individual. But, based on the vast range of patristic
theology, he was able to demonstrate that salvation has always been considered
also a “social” reality. He cites the Letter to the Hebrews that speaks of a
“city” (cf. Heb 11:10,16; 12:22; 13:14) and therefore salvation as communal.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch21.p8">
        <p>Consistent with the view of the Early Fathers, sin is understood as the
destruction of the unity of the human race, much like the sin of idolatry was
the cause of the division and fragmentation of languages at Babel. Hence,
“redemption” appeared to be the only way to re-establish unity, “a union that
takes shape in the world community of believers. St. Augustine also tried to
explain the phrase: ”knowing without knowing“ He called it simply the
”blessed life. He quotes Psalm 144:15, “Blessed the people whose God is the
Lord.” He goes on, “in order to be numbered among this people and attain
everlasting life with God, ’the end commandment is charity that issues from a
pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith.”’ ( 1 Tim 1:5) What then is
the “blessed life” that we, not I alone, are reaching for? A “lived union
with a ’people.”’ Each individual can attain union only within this “we.” The
“blessed life” presupposes we escape from the prison of “I”, from oneself,
and open our gaze to that universal joy, God, in whom we believe, in whom we
hope, and whom we love, and as a community attain the “blessed life.”

<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 6975 **** -->32. and 33. A first essential setting for learning hope is prayer. When no one
listens to me any more, God still listens to me. When I can no longer talk to
anyone or call upon anyone, I can always talk to God. When there is no longer
anyone to help me deal with a need or expectation that goes beyond the human
capacity for hope, he can help me. (cf. CCC 2657) Saint Augustine, in a homily
on the 1st Letter of St. John, describes very beautifully the intimate
relationship between prayer and hope. He defines prayer as an exercise of
desire. Man was created for greatness for God himself; he was created to be
filled by God. But his heart is too small for the greatness to which it is
destined. It must be stretched. “By delaying [his gift] God strengthens our
desire; through desire he enlarges our soul and by expanding it he increases its
capacity [for receiving him].”

        <p>Action and suffering as settings for learning hope
35. and 36. All serious and upright human conduct is hope in action. This is so
in the sense that we thereby strive to realize our lesser and greater hopes, to
complete this or that task which is important to us for our onward journey. Like
action, suffering is a part of our human existence. Suffering stems partly from
our finitude, and partly from the mass of sin which has accumulated and
continues to accumulate unabated today. Certainly we must do whatever we can to
reduce suffering … of the innocent, mental suffering and other kinds. These
are obligations both in justice and in love. But to banish suffering from the
world altogether is not in our power, because we are finite. Only God is able to
do this: only a God who personally enters history by making himself man and
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 7000 **** -->suffering within history, only he has the power to “take away the sin of the
world.” (Jn 1:29) Through faith in the existence of this power, and hope that
healing for the world will emerge, it is hope, not yet fulfilled, that gives us
courage to place ourselves on the side of good even in seemingly hopeless
situations, realizing that the power of sin will continue to be a terrible
presence.

        <p>Chapter 1. Challenges Facing Priestly Formation
Young People: Vocation and Priestly Formation!
8. Adolescents and young men are continually under pressure and facing
obstacles. The all-determining “concern” for having supplants the primacy of
being, and consequently personal and interpersonal values are interpreted and
lived not according to the logic of giving and generosity but according to the
logic of selfish possession and the exploitation of others.
In the case of some young people a distorted sense of freedom lies at the root
of these tendencies. Instead of being understood as obedience to objective and
universal truth, freedom is lived out as a blind acquiescence to instinctive
forces and to an individual’s will to power. In this context it is difficult not
only to respond fully to a vocation to the priesthood but even to understand its
very meaning as a special witness to the primacy of “being” or “having.”
Often the world of young people is a “problem” in the church community
itself. In fact, often in them - more so than in adults - there is present a
strong tendency to subjectivize the Christian faith and to belong only partially
and conditionally to the life and mission of the church. If the church community
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 7050 **** -->is slow for a variety of reasons to initiate and sustain an up-to-date and
courageous pastoral care for young people, they risk being left to themselves,
at the mercy of their psychological frailty, dissatisfied and critical of a
world of adults who, in failing to live the faith in a consistent and mature
fashion, do not appear to them as credible models.

church’s mystery as a mystery of trinitarian communion in missionary tension,
that every Christian identity is revealed, and likewise the specific identity of
the priest and his ministry. The nature and mission of the ministerial
priesthood cannot be defined except through this rich and multiple
interconnection of relationships which arise from the Blessed Trinity and are
prolonged in the communion of the church, as a sign and instrument of Christ, of
communion with God and of the unity of all humanity. Reference to the church is
therefore necessary, though not primary, in defining the identity of the
priest. The priest is a living and transparent image of Christ the

into the ministry. Through the laying on of hands which transmits the gift of

reconciliation, of shepherding the flock of God and of teaching. Therefore,
priests are called to prolong the presence of Christ, the one high priest,
embodying his way of life and making him visible in the midst of the flock
entrusted to their care.
In the church and on behalf of the church, priests are a sacramental
representation of Jesus Christ, the head and shepherd, authoritatively
proclaiming his word, repeating his acts of forgiveness and his offer of
salvation, particularly in Baptism, Penance and the Eucharist. By the
sacramental anointing of holy orders, the Holy Spirit configures them in a new
and special way to Jesus Christ the head and shepherd.

that disposition of soul by which priests are always ready to seek not their own

of the priest that obedience takes on certain special characteristics.</p>

        <p>First of all, obedience is “apostolic” in the sense that it recognizes, loves
and serves the church in her hierarchical structure. “Submission” to those
invested with ecclesial authority is in no way a kind of humiliation. Instead
submission flows from the responsible freedom of the priest, from the grace of
discernment for the safeguarding of the mystery of the church.
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 7175 **** -->Priestly obedience has also a “community” dimension: It is deeply a part of
the unity of the presbyterate, which as such is called to cooperate harmoniously
with the bishop and, through him, with Peter’s successor. Priestly obedience is
marked by the spirit of asceticism. Priestly obedience should be one of
solidarity … within the presbyterate, expressed in co-responsibility regarding
directions to be taken and choices to be made.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch22.p19">
        <p>Finally, obedience has a particular “pastoral” character. The priest lives in
an atmosphere of constant readiness to allow himself to be “consumed” by the
needs and demands of the flock. The gift of self is best expressed in virginity,
celibacy and chastity that is absolute and perpetual. Chastity in priestly
celibacy is a charism. The Latin church requires that the priesthood be
conferred only on those men who have received from God the gift of the vocation
to celibate chastity. The synod does not wish to leave any doubts in the mind of
anyone regarding the church’s firm will to maintain the law that demands
perpetual and freely chosen celibacy for present and future candidates for
priestly ordination in the Latin rite.

to be aware that the priest will never lack the grace of the Holy Spirit as a
totally gratuitous gift and as a task which he is called to undertake. Awareness
of this gift is the foundation and support of the priest’s unflagging trust amid
the difficulties, temptations and weaknesses which he will meet along his
spiritual path. The priestly vocation is essentially a call to holiness,
intimacy with God, imitation of Christ who was poor, chaste and humble; it is
unreserved love of souls, love of the church and commitment to the mission

it is an essential part of the overall pastoral work of each church, a concern
which demands to be integrated into and fully identified with the ordinary
“care of souls,” a connatural and essential dimension of the church’s pastoral
work, of her very life and mission.
Each Christian vocation comes from God and is God’s gift! The church not only
embraces in herself all the vocations (marriage, holy orders, the single state,

who calls each one of us in Jesus Christ, and to the genuine meaning of human
freedom as the principle driving force behind the responsible gift of oneself

knowledge of the word of God and a prayerful familiarity with it are

To be utterly frank and clear, I would like to say once again: “It is fitting
that seminarians take part every day in the eucharistic celebration, in such a
way that afterward they will take up, as a rule of their priestly life, this
daily celebration. Candidates to the priesthood will be trained to share in the
intimate dispositions which the Eucharist fosters: gratitude for heavenly
benefits received, because the Eucharist is thanksgiving; an attitude of
self-offering; charity nourished by a sacrament, which is a sign of unity and
sharing; the yearning to contemplate and bow in adoration before Christ, who is

        <p>Note: This Encyclical Letter has extraordinary relevance to the changing times
in which we live. From the perspective of caritas, charity, it presents
Christian truth, veritas, on a variety of inter-related issues of paramount
urgency in today’s world such as integral social development of all peoples,
more equitable distribution of wealth between developed and underdeveloped
nations, vocation to development, justice, the common good, freedom, systems of
welfare, access to food and water as a human right, gratuitousness, solidarity
among peoples, energy, environment, migration, poverty and unemployment, the
current global economic crisis, the phenomenon of globalization, etc.</p>

        <p>1. Charity in truth, to which Jesus Christ bore witness by his earthly life and
especially by his death and resurrection, is the principal force behind the
authentic development of every person and of all humanity. Love caritas is an
extraordinary force which leads people to opt for courageous and generous
engagement in the field of justice and peace. It is a force that has its origin
in God, Eternal Love and Absolute Truth. Each person finds his good by adherence
to God’s plan for him, in order to realize it fully in this plan, he finds his
truth, and through adherence to this truth he becomes free (cf. Jn 8:22) To
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 7550 **** -->defend the truth, to articulate it with humility and conviction, and to bear
witness to it in life are therefore exacting and indispensable forms of charity,
Charity, in fact, “rejoices in the truth” (1 Cor 13:6). All people feel the
interior impulse to love authentically: love and truth never abandon them
completely, because these are the vocation planted by God in the heart and mind
of every human person. The search for love and truth is purified and liberated
by Jesus Christ from the impoverishment that our humanity brings to it, and he
reveals to us in all its fullness the initiative of love and the plan for true
life that God has prepared for us. In Christ, charity in truth becomes the Face
of his Person, a vocation for us to love our brothers and sisters in the truth
of his plan. Indeed he himself is the Truth (cf. Jn 14:6).

        <p>2. Charity is at the heart of the Church’s social doctrine. Every responsibility
and every commitment spelled out by that doctrine is derived from charity which,
according to the teaching of Jesus, is the synthesis of the entire Law (cf. Mt
22:36-40). It gives real substance to the personal relationship with God and
with neighbor; it is the principle not only of micro-relationships (with
friends, with family members or with small groups) but also of
macro-relationships (social, economic and political ones). For the Church,
instructed by the Gospel, charity is everything because, as Saint John teaches
(cf. 1 Jn 4:8,16) and as I recalled in my first Encyclical Letter,“God is
love,” Deus Caritas Est, everything has its origin in God’s love, everything is
shaped by it, everything is directed towards it. Love is God’s greatest gift to
humanity; it is his promise and our hope.

        <p>I am aware of the ways in which charity has been and continues to be
misconstrued and emptied of meaning, with the consequent risk of being
misinterpreted, detached from ethical living and, in any event, undervalued. In
the social, juridical, cultural, political and economic fields the contents, in
other words, that are most exposed to danger it is easily dismissed as
irrelevant for interpreting and giving direction to moral responsibility. Hence
the need to link charity with truth not only in the sequence pointed out by
Saint Paul of veritas in caritate (Eph 4:15), but also inverse and complementary
sequence of caritas in veritate. Truth needs to be sought, found and expressed
within the “economy” of charity, but charity in its turn needs to be
understood, confirmed and practiced in the light of truth.</p>

also help give credibility to truth, demonstrating its persuasive and
authenticating power in the practical setting of social living. This is a matter
of no small account today, in a social and cultural context which relativizes
truth, often paying little heed to it and showing increasing reluctance to
acknowledge its existence

        <p>5. Charity is love received and given. It is “grace” (charis). Its source is
the wellspring of the Father’s love for his Son, in the Holy Spirit. Love comes
down to us from the Son. It is creative love, through which we have our being;
it is redemptive love, through which we are recreated. Love is revealed and made
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 7600 **** -->present by Christ (cf. Jn 13:1) and “poured into our hearts through the Holy
Spirit” (Rom 5:5). As the objects of God’s love, men and women become subjects
of charity; they are called to make themselves instruments of grace, so as to
pour forth God’s charity and to weave networks of charity. This dynamic of
charity received and given is what give rise to the Church’s social teaching,
which is caritas in veritate in re sociali, the proclamation of the truth of
Christ’s love in society. This doctrine is a service to charity, but its locus
is truth. Truth preserves and expresses charity’s power to liberate in the
ever-changing events of history. Development [is] social well-being, the search
for a satisfactory solution to the grave socio-economic problems besetting
humanity, all need this truth. What they need even more is that this truth
should be loved and demonstrated. Without truth, without trust and love for what
is true, there is no social conscience and responsibility, and social action
ends up serving private interests and the logic of power, resulting in social
fragmentation, especially in a globalized society at difficult times like the
present.

good.”</p>

        <p>Ubi societas, ibi jus: every society draws up its own system of justice. Charity
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 7625 **** -->goes beyond Justice because to love is to give, to offer what is “mine” to the
other; but it never lacks justice, which prompts us to give the other what is
“his,” what is due him. If we love others with charity, then first of all we
are just towards him. Not only is justice not extraneous to charity, not only is
it not an alternative or parallel path to charity: justice is inseparable from
charity, and intrinsic to it. Justice is the primary way of charity, an integral
part of the love “in deed and in truth” (1 Jn 3:18). On the one hand, charity
demands justice: recognition and respect for the legitimate rights of
individuals and peoples. It strives to build the earthly city according to law
and justice. On the other hand, charity transcends justice and completes it in
the logic of giving and forgiving. The earthly city is promoted not merely by
relationships of rights and duties, but to an even greater and more fundamental
extent by relationships of gratuitousness, mercy and communion. Charity always
manifests God’s love in human relationships as well, it gives theological and
salvific value to all commitment for justice in the world.

        <p>7. and 9. The Common Good! To love someone is to desire that person’s good and
take effective steps to secure it. Besides the good of the individual there is a
good that is linked to living in society: the common good. It is the good of
“all of us,” made up of individuals, families and intermediate groups who
together constitute society. It is a good that is sought not for its own sake,
but for the people who belong to the social community, and who can only really
and effectively pursue their good within it. To desire the common good and
strive toward it is a requirement of justice and charity. To take a stand for
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 7650 **** -->the common good is to be solicitous for and avail oneself of that complex of
institutions that give structure to the life of society. The more we strive to
secure a common good corresponding to the real needs of our neighbors, the more
effectively we love them. Every Christian is called to practice this charity, in
a manner corresponding to his vocation and according to the degree of influence
he wields in the polis, or “city.”</p>

        <p>The institutional or political path of charity is no less excellent and
effective than the kind of charity which encounters the neighbor directly,
outside the institutional mediation of the polis. When animated by charity,
commitment to the common good has greater worth than a merely secular and
political stand would have. Like all commitment to justice, it has a place
within the testimony of divine charity that paves the way for eternity through
temporal action. Man’s earthly activity, when inspired and sustained by charity,
contributes to the building of the universal city of God, which is the goal of
the history of the human family. In an increasingly globalized society, the
common good and the effort to obtain it cannot fail to assume the dimension of
the whole human family, that is to say, the community of peoples and nations, in
such a way as to shape the earthly city in unity and peace, rendering it to some
degree an anticipation and a prefiguration of the undivided city of God.</p>

have a mission of truth to accomplish, in every time and circumstance, for a
society that is attuned to man, to his dignity, to his vocation. Fidelity to man

Paul VI’s Encyclical Letter, Populorum Progressio, PP, 1967, and for the
profound insights he had on the development of peoples prior to Vatican Council
II. Now over forty years later, Pope Benedict’s aim in his Encyclical Letter
Caritas in Veritate, “Charity in Truth,” is to address “the different terms
in which the problem of development is presented today.”</p>

        <p>The Council probed more deeply what has always belonged to the truth of the
faith, namely that the Church, being at God’s service, is at the service of the
world in terms of love and truth. Paul VI set out from this vision in order to
convey two important truths. The first is that the whole Church, in all her
being and acting when she proclaims, when she celebrates, when she performs
works of charity is engaged in promoting integral human development. She has a
public role over and above her charitable and educational activities: with all
energy to advance humanity and universal fraternity … in a climate of
freedom. The second truth is that authentic human development concerns the whole
of the person in every single dimension. Man does not develop through his own
powers, nor can development simply be handed to him. Only through an encounter
with God are we able to see in the other something more than just another
creature, to recognize the divine image in the other, thus truly coming to
discover him or her and to mature in love that “becomes concern and care for
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 7700 **** -->another.”

at the same time ever new. The Church’s social doctrine illuminates with an
unchanging light the new problems that are constantly emerging. This doctrine
points definitively to the New Man, to the “last Adam [who] became a
life-giving spirit” (1 Cor 15:45), the principle of charity that “never ends”
(1 Cor 13:8) Speaking of Paul VI, Pope Benedict credits him for this profound
insight: In the notion of development, understood in human and Christian terms,
he identified the heart of the Christian social message, and proposed Christian
charity as the principal force at the service of development.</p>

        <p>15. The idea of a world without development indicates a lack of trust in man and
in God. It is a serious mistake to undervalue human capacity to exercise control
of the deviations of development or to overlook the fact that man is
constitutionally oriented towards “being more.”
Here Pope Benedict emphasizes the importance of the Encyclical Humanae Vitae in
which Paul VI states that to “devalue and violate” human life where it is
weakest is contrary to “life ethics and social ethics” and therefore contrary
to“the fully human meaning of the development that the Church proposes.” Pope
Benedict also quotes Paul VI’s Apostolic Exhortation, Evangelii Nuntiandi:
“Between evangelization and human advancement development and liberation
there are in fact profound links.” Benedict goes on: Testimony to Christ’s
charity, through works of justice, peace and development, is part and parcel of
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 7725 **** -->evangelization, because Jesus Christ, who loves us, is concerned with the whole
person. The Church’s social doctrine “is an essential element of
evangelization,” “an instrument and an indispensable setting for formation in
faith.”

        <p>16. and 17. In Populorum Progressio, Paul VI taught that progress, in its origin
and essence, is first and foremost avocation: “in the design of God, every man
is called upon to develop and fulfil himself, for every life is a vocation.”
This teaching is what gives legitimacy to the Church’s involvement in the whole
question of development, states Benedict. He continues: To regard development as
a vocation is to recognize, that it derives from a transcendent call, and that
it is incapable, on its own, of supplying its ultimate meaning. “There is no
true humanism but that which is open to the Absolute” writes Paul VI, “and is
conscious of a vocation which gives human life its true meaning.” This vision
of development is at the heart of PP, and it lies behind all Paul VI’s
reflections on freedom, on truth and on charity in development. It is also the
principal reason why this Encyclical is still timely in our day.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch23.p19">
        <p>A vocation is a call that requires a free and responsible answer. Integral human
development presupposes the responsible freedom of the individual and of
peoples: no structure can guarantee this development over and above human
responsibility. The “types of messianism which gives promises but create
illusions” (CA 25) always build their case on a denial of the transcendent
dimension of development, in the conviction that it lies entirely at their
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 7750 **** -->disposal. This false security becomes weakness, because it involves reducing man
to subservience, to a mere means for development, while the humility of those
who accept a vocation is transformed into true autonomy, because it set them
free. Paul VI was in no doubt that obstacles and forms of conditioning hold up
development, but he was also certain that “each one remains, whatever be these
influences affecting him, the principal agent of his own success or failure.”

        <p>18. Besides requiring freedom, integral human development as a vocation demands
respect for its truth. The vocation to progress drives us to“do more, know more
and have more in order to be more.” (PP 6) The Christian vision has the
particular characteristic of asserting and justifying the unconditional value of
the human person and the meaning of his growth.. In promoting development, the
Christian faith does not rely on privilege or positions of power, nor on the
merits of Christians (even though these existed and continue to exist alongside
their natural limitations), but only on Christ, to whom every authentic vocation
to integral human development must be directed. The Gospel is fundamental for
development, because in the Gospel, Christ, “in the very revelation of the
mystery of the Father and of his love, fully reveals humanity to itself.” [M]an
cannot fail to open himself to the divine vocation to pursue his own
development. The truth of development consists in its completeness: if it does
not involve the whole man and every man, it is not true development.

      <para xml:id="Ch23.p21">
        <p>19. Finally, the vision of development as a vocation brings with it the central
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 7775 **** -->place of charity within that development. The causes of underdevelopment are not
primarily of the material order, stated Paul VI in PP, 20. The other cause is
the lack of solidarity, and a search of “new humanism,” that can fill “the
lack of brotherhood among individuals and peoples.” As society becomes ever
more globalized, it makes us neighbors but does not make us brothers. Though
stability may be present due to “civic coexistence,” it is not and does not
establish fraternity. It originates in a transcendent vocation from God the
Father, who loved us first, teaching us through the Son what fraternal charity
is. After faith “the summit” of development is “unity in the charity of
Christ who calls us all to share as sons in the life of the living God, the
Father of all.” Pope Paul VI in PP 3, 29, 32 states that what underlies the
problems of injustice in the development of peoples is the urgent need for
reform. This urgency is also a consequence of charity in truth.“ It is Christ’s
charity that drives us on: ”for the love of Christ impels us (2 Cor 5:14) Most
urgent in the development of peoples is establishment of authentic fraternity.

Benedict goes back to Pope Paul VI’s Encyclical, Populorum Progressio whose
vision of development centered on rescuing people from hunger, depravation,
endemic diseases and illiteracy. But today the world has moved beyond
technological problems. Now in the midst of a global economic crisis due to the
malfunctions of international policies and politics, it is desperately seeking
solutions. The crisis, states Benedict, “becomes an opportunity for
discernment, in which to shape a new vision for the future.”

        <p>Today the picture of development has many overlapping layers. The world’s wealth
is growing in absolute terms, but inequalities are on the increase. In rich
countries, new sectors of society are succumbing to poverty and new forms of
poverty are emerging. Corruption and illegality are unfortunately evident in the
conduct of the economic and political class in rich countries as well as in poor
ones. Among those who sometimes fail to respect the human rights of workers are
large multinational companies as well as local producers. Rich countries often
protect excessively “intellectual property, especially in the field of health
care.” After the political and economic systems of Communist countries
collapsed, a complete re-examination of development was needed. “[A]
comprehensive new plan for development” began to take shape. Today, as we take
to heart the lessons of the current economic crisis, which sees the State’s
public authorities directly involved in correcting errors and malfunctions, it
seems more realistic to re-evaluate their role and their powers, which need to
be prudently reviewed and remodelled so as to enable them, perhaps through new
forms of engagement, to address the challenges of today’s world.

harder to find in today’s profoundly changed environment. “The global market
has stimulated a search for areas in which to outsource production at low cost
with a view to reducing the prices of many goods.” The aim is for “increasing
purchasing power, and thus accelerating the rate of development in terms of
greater availability of consumer goods for the domestic market.” But the market
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 7825 **** -->has prompted new forms of competition between States they seek to attract
foreign businesses to set up production centers, by means of a variety of
instruments, including favorable fiscal regimes and deregulation of the labor
market. These processes have led to a downsizing of social security systems, the
price to be paid for seeking greater competitive advantage in the global market,
with consequent grave danger for the rights of workers, for fundamental human
rights and the solidarity associated with the traditional forms of the social
State. Trade union organizations experience greater difficulty in carrying out
their task of representing the interests of workers, partly because Governments

dependent on public or private assistance for prolonged periods undermines the
freedom and creativity of the person and his family and social relationships,
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 7850 **** -->causing great psychological and spiritual suffering.” Pope Benedict states
firmly that the primary capital to be safeguarded and valued is man, the human

universal Church given it by Christ, its Founder, the Lord Jesus. The reality,
however, is that life in many poor countries is like Lazarus who was not
permitted to take his place at the rich man’s table. It is therefore necessary
to cultivate a public conscience that considers food and access to water as
universal rights of all human beings without distinction or discrimination. It
is important, moreover, to emphasize that solidarity with poor countries in the
process of development can point towards a solution of the current global
crisis. Some politicians and directors of international institutions are coming
to realize that through support for economically poor countries by means of
financial plans inspired by solidarity so that these countries can take steps
to satisfy their own citizens’ demand for consumer goods and for development
not only can true economic growth be generated, but a contribution can be made
towards sustaining the productive capacities of rich countries that risk being

demographic control, which means some governments promote contraception, and
even imposes abortion. In economically developed countries, legislation contrary
to life is very widespread which shapes moral attitudes and leads to an
anti-birth mentality. Attempts to export and even threaten to; impose this

include all economies. It has been the driving force behind the emergence from

force could cause unprecedented damage and create new divisions within the human

them gratuitously in vast abundance. Gratuitousness means that gifts are given
and received without meriting or deserving them. The Prime Gift Giver is
God. Selfishly closed in on ourselves, sometimes modern man is convinced he is
the sole author of himself, his gifts and his life. In faith terms, like every
other human being he is infected with original sin. He is a stranger to anything
transcendent. The conviction that man is self-sufficient and can successfully
eliminate the evil present in history by his own action has led him to confuse
happiness and salvation with immanent forms of material prosperity and social
action. He is convinced that the economy must be autonomous; that it must be
shielded from “influences”.of a moral character. This conviction has led him
to abuse the economic process, most frequently by trampling on personal and
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 7950 **** -->social freedom, thereby eliminating any hope of integral human development,
freedom and justice. Caritas in veritate feeds on hope, an absolutely gratuitous
gift of God. Hope comes into our lives as something not due to us.</p>

it goes beyond merit, and is a sign of God’s presence in us. Truth, also a gift
as charity, is given gratuitously without our meriting it. Truth is not
something that we produce, it is always found, or better, received. Truth, like
love, “is neither planned nor willed, but somehow imposes itself upon human
beings.” Charity in truth is a force that builds community, it brings all
people together without imposing barriers or limits. The human community that we
build by ourselves can never, purely by our own strength, be a fully fraternal
community, nor can it overcome every division and a truly universal
community. The unity of the human race, a fraternal communion transcending every
barrier, is called into being by the word of God-who-is-love. If integral, human
development is to be authentic, it needs to make room for the principle of
gratuitousness as an expression of fraternity.

economic institution that permits encounters between persons in contracts, and
in the exchange of goods and services that satisfy their needs and desires. The
market is subject to the principles of communitive justice, i.e. it regulates
the giving and receiving between parties in a transaction. The Church’s social
doctrine, however, highlights the importance of distributive justice and social
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 7975 **** -->justice in the network of relations. Distributive justice aims not only at
equivalency as in the market, but is guided by forms of internal solidarity,
mutual trust. Here the “poor” are not to be considered a burden, but a
resource, an opportunity to provide goods to those who are not capable of
generating them. But the “poor” are not to be exploited. Economic activity
cannot solve all social problems through an application of commercial logic. It
needs to be directed towards the pursuit of the common good. This pursuit is
primarily the responsibility of the political community. It is man’s motivation
that produces consequences: his darkened reason produces harmful consequences,
his unselfish reason produces good consequences.Therefore it is not the
instrument per se that must be called to account, but individuals, their moral
conscience and their social responsibility. The Church’s social doctrine holds
that authentically social relationships of friendship, solidarity and
reciprocity can also be conducted within economic activity, and not only outside
it or “after” it. The economic sphere is neither ethically neutral, nor
inherently inhuman and opposed to society. It is part and parcel of human
activity and precisely because it is human, it must be structured and governed
in an ethical manner.
The great challenge before us, accentuated by the problems of development in
this global era and made even more urgent by the “economic and financial
crisis” (e.g. the U.S. economic recession beginning in 2009), is to
demonstrate, in thinking and behavior, not only that traditional principles of
social ethics like transparency, honesty and responsibility cannot be ignored or
attenuated, but also that in commercial relationships the principle of
gratuitousness and the logic of gift as an expression of fraternity can and must
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 8000 **** -->find their place within normal economic activity. This is a human demand at the
present time, but it is also demanded by economic logic. It is a demand both of
charity and of truth.

and civil society. He saw civil society as the most natural setting for an
economy of gratuitousness and fraternity. He did not deny their place in the
other two settings. Pope Benedict goes on to say “that economic life must be
understood as a multi-layered phenomenon.” In each of these settings are
varying degrees and ways suited to each, namely the aspect of fraternal
reciprocity: gratuitousness which fosters and disseminates solidarity and
responsibility for justice and the common good among different economic players;
solidarity which is first and foremost a sense of responsibility on the part of
everyone with regard to everyone, and it cannot therefore be merely delegated to
the State. What is needed is a market that permits the free operation, in

subjected to a process of discernment. The truth of globalization as a process

April 27, 2001. We should not be victims of it, but protagonists guided by
charity and truth. Look at the positive aspects: the processes of globalization
open up the unprecedented possibility of large-scale redistribution of wealth on
a worldwide scale. But if badly directed they could lead to an increase of
poverty and inequality that could trigger a global crisis. It is necessary to
correct the malfunctions: heal the divisions between peoples and within peoples,
and making sure that redistribution of wealth does not cause redistribution of
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 8050 **** -->poverty, a real danger in the present situation. Paul VI strongly opposed the
mentality that poor peoples should remain at a fixed stage of development, and
rely on and be content with philanthropic assistance of developed
peoples. Material resources are potentially greater now than before. They should
not end up in the hands of people in developed countries only.
The worldwide diffusion of forms of prosperity should not therefore be held up
by projects that are self-centered, protectionist or at the service of private
interests. The transition inherent in the process of globalization presents
great difficulties and dangers that can only be overcome if we are able to
appropriate the underlying anthropological and ethical spirit that drives
globalization towards the humanizing goal of solidarity. Unfortunately this
spirit is often overwhelmed or suppressed by ethical and cultural considerations
of an individualistic and utilitarian nature. Globalization is a multifaceted
and complex phenomenon. Besides its diversity and its potential for unity, it
has also a theological dimension. In this way it will be possible to experience
and to steer the globalization of humanity in relational terms, in terms of
communion and the sharing of goods.

energy problem are inseparable. Man must be concerned not just about environment
or only about energy but with the whole of creation. We who live in this
generation must not bequeath to future generations a world depleted of its
resources. Human beings legitimately exercise a responsible stewardship over
nature when they “protect” it, “enjoy” its fruits and “cultivate in new
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 8075 **** -->ways, with the assistance of advanced technologies, so that it can worthily
accommodate and feed the world’s population.” On this earth there is room for
everyone, here the entire human family must find the resources to live with
dignity, through the help of nature itself God’s gift to his children and
through hard work and creativity. At the same time we must recognize our grave
duty to hand the earth on to future generations in such a condition that they
too can worthily inhabit it and continue to cultivate it. This means being
committed to making joint decisions “after pondering responsibly the road to be
taken, decisions aimed at strengthening that covenant between human beings and
the environment, which should mirror the creative love of God, from whom we come
and towards whom we are journeying.” (Benedict XVI, Message for the 2008 World
Day of Peace, 13)
Let us hope that the international community and individual governments will
succeed in countering harmful ways of treating the environment. It is likewise
incumbent upon the competent authorities to make every effort to ensure that the
economic and social costs of using up shared environmental resources are
recognized with transparency and fully borne by those who incur them, not by
other peoples or future generations: the protection of the environment, of
resources and of the climate obliges all international leaders to act jointly
and to show a readiness to work in good faith, respecting the law and promoting
solidarity with the weakest regions of the planet. One of the greatest
challenges facing the economy is to achieve the most efficient use not abuse
of natural resources, based on a realization that the notion of “efficiency”

this shared sense of being close to one another must be transformed into true

human creature is defined through interpersonal relations. The more
authentically he or she lives these relations, the more his or her own personal

of the biblical “rest” of God, it is nonetheless to the resurrection of Christ
that we must look in order to understand fully the Lord’s Day. This is what the
Christian Sunday does, leading the faithful each week to ponder and live the
event of Easter, true source of the world’s salvation.

        <p>The Day of the Gift of the Spirit
28. Sunday, the day of light, could also be called the day of “fire,” in
reference to the Holy Spirit. The light of Christ is intimately linked to the
“fire” of the Spirit and the two images together reveal the meaning of the
Christian Sunday. When he appeared to the apostles on the evening of Easter,
Jesus breathed upon them and said: “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the
sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are
retained” (Jn 20:22-23).</p>

in power as “a mighty wind” and “fire” (Acts 2:2-3), upon the apostles
gathered with Mary. Pentecost is not only the founding event of the church, but
is also the mystery which forever gives life to the church. Such an event has
its own powerful liturgical moment in the annual celebration which concludes
“the great Sunday,” but it also remains part of the deep meaning of every
Sunday because of its intimate bond with the paschal mystery. The “weekly
Easter” thus becomes, in a sense, the “weekly Pentecost,” when Christians
relive the Apostles’ joyful encounter with the risen Lord and receive the
life-giving breath of his Spirit.</p>

<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 8400 **** -->29. Given these different dimensions which set it apart, Sunday appears as a
supreme day of faith. It is the day when, by the power of the Holy Spirit who is
the church’s living “memory” (cf. Jn 14:26), the first appearance of the risen
Lord becomes an event renewed in the “today” of each of Christ’s
disciples. Yes, Sunday is the day of faith. This is stressed by the fact that
the Sunday Eucharistic liturgy, like the liturgy of other solemnities, includes
the Profession of Faith. Recited or sung, the Creed declares the baptismal and
Paschal character of Sunday, making it the day on which in a special way the
baptized renew their adherence to Christ and his Gospel in a rekindled awareness
of their baptismal promises.

The Eucharistic Assembly: Heart of Sunday
31. “I am with you always, to the end of the age” (Mt 28:20). This promise of
Christ never ceases to resound in the church as the fertile secret of her life
and the wellspring of her hope. As the day of Resurrection, Sunday is not only
the remembrance of a past event: it is a celebration of the living presence of
the Risen Lord in the midst of his people. It is important, therefore, that they
come together to express fully the very identity of the church, the ement of the
body and blood of the Lord, the mystery of the church is savored, proclaimed and
lived supremely in the Eucharist. This ecclesial dimension, intrinsic to the
Eucharist, is realized in every Eucharistic celebration. But it is expressed
most especially on the day when the whole community comes together to
commemorate the Lord’s Resurrection. Significantly, the Catechism of the
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 8425 **** -->Catholic Church teaches that “the Sunday celebration of the Lord’s Day and his
Eucharist is at the heart of the Church’s life.” (CCC 2177)

        <p>The Sunday Eucharist
34. By its very nature, the Eucharist is an epiphany of the church; and this is
most powerfully expressed when the diocesan community gathers in prayer with its
Pastor: “The church appears with special clarity when the holy People of God,
all of them, are actively and fully sharing in the same liturgical celebrations
especially when it is the same Eucharist sharing one prayer at one altar, at
which the bishop is presiding, surrounded by his presbyters and ministers.” But
because of its special solemnity and the obligatory presence of the community
and because it is celebrated “on the day when Christ conquered death and gave
us a share in his immortal life,” the Sunday Eucharist expresses with greater
emphasis its inherent ecclesial dimension.</p>

35, 36. Therefore the dies Domini is also the dies ecclesiae. This is why on the
pastoral level the community aspect of Sunday celebration should be particularly
stressed. Among the many activates of a parish, “none is as vital or as
community-forming as the Sunday celebration of the Lord’s Day and his
Eucharist.” Mindful of this, the Second Vatican Council recalled that efforts
must be made to ensure that there is “within the parish a lively sense of
community, in the first place through the community celebration of Sunday
Mass.” This is why on Sunday, the day of gathering, small group Masses should
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 8450 **** -->be discouraged: it is not only a question of ensuring that parish assemblies are
not without the necessary ministry of priests, but also of ensuring that the
life and unity of the church community are fully safeguarded and promoted.

        <p>The Table of the Word!
39. As in every Eucharistic celebration, the Risen Lord is encountered in the
Sunday assembly at the twofold table of the word and of the Bread of Life. The
table of the word offers the same understanding of the history of salvation and
especially of the paschal mystery which the risen Jesus himself gave to his
disciples: it is Christ who speaks, present as he is in his word “when Sacred
Scripture is read in the church.”</p>

      <para xml:id="Ch24.p20">
        <p>At the table of the Bread of Life, the Risen Lord becomes really, substantially,
and enduringly present through the memorial of his Passion and Resurrection, and
the Bread of Life is offered as a pledge of future glory. The Second Vatican
Council recalled that “the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist
are so closely joined together that they form a single act of worship.” The
council also urged that “the table of the word of God be more lavishly prepared
for the faithful, opening to them more abundantly the treasures of the Bible.”
It then decreed that, in Masses of Sunday and holy days of obligation, the
homily should not be omitted except for serious reasons. Paul VI wrote,
commenting upon the richer offering of biblical readings on Sundays and holy
days: “All this has been decreed so as to foster more and more in the faithful
’that hunger for hearing the word of the Lord’ (Am 8:11) which, under the
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 8475 **** -->guidance of the Holy Spirit, spurs the people of the new covenant on toward the
perfect unity of the church.”</p>

        <p>40. In considering the Sunday Eucharist more than thirty years after the
council, we need to assess how well the word of God is being proclaimed and how
effectively the people of God have grown in knowledge and love of Sacred
Scripture. There are two aspects of this that of celebration and that of
personal appropriation and they are very closely related.</p>

        <p>If Christian individuals and families are not regularly drawing new life from
the reading of the sacred text in a spirit of prayer and docility to the

the word of God alone to produce the fruit we might expect. This is the value of
initiatives in parish communities which bring together during the week those who
take part in the Eucharist priest, ministers, and faithful in order to prepare
the Sunday liturgy, reflecting beforehand upon the word of God which will be
proclaimed. The objective sought here is that the entire celebration praying,
singing, listening and not just preaching should express in some way the theme
of the Sunday liturgy, so that all those taking part may be penetrated more
powerfully by it.

Eucharist appears more clearly than on other days as the great “thanksgiving”
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 8500 **** -->in which the Spirit-filled church turns to the Father, becoming one with Christ
and speaking in the name of all humanity. Then, giving assent to the Eucharistic
doxology with their “Amen”, the People of God look in faith and hope toward
the eschatological end, when Christ “will deliver the kingdom to God the Father

of bread and wine, upon which has been invoked the outpouring of the Spirit, who
works with absolutely unique power in the words of consecration, Christ offers
himself to the Father in the same act of sacrifice by which he offered himself
on the Cross. To his sacrifice Christ unites the sacrifice of the Church: “In
the Eucharist the sacrifice of Christ becomes also the sacrifice of the members
of his Body. The lives of the faithful, their praise, sufferings, prayer and
work, are united with those of Christ and with his total offering, and so
acquire a new value.” The truth that the whole community shares in Christ’s
sacrifice is especially evident in the Sunday gathering, which makes it possible
to bring to the altar the week that has passed, with all its human burdens.

46. Since the Eucharist is the very heart of Sunday, it is clear why, from the
earliest centuries, the Pastors of the Church have not ceased to remind the
faithful of the need to take part in the liturgical assembly. “Leave everything
on the Lord’s Day,” urges the third-century text known as the Didascalia, “and
run diligently to your assembly, because it is your praise of God.”

into a universal law. The present code reiterates this, saying that “on Sundays
and other holy days of obligation, the faithful are bound to attend Mass.” This
legislation has normally been understood as entailing a grave obligation: This
is the teaching of the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC 2181), and it is

they should come together with others on Sundays to celebrate the Passover of

before the passion and which resound in every Christian generation: “You will
be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn to joy.” The festive character of the

Sunday is its fulfillment and in a certain sense its extension and full

rest. Only in the fourth century did the civil law of the Roman Empire recognize
the weekly recurrence, determining that on “the day of the sun” the judges,
the people of the cities and the various trade corporations would not
work. Christians rejoiced to see thus removed the obstacles which until then had
sometimes made observance of the Lord’s Day heroic. They could now devote
themselves to prayer in common without hindrance.</p>

only does not absolve the faithful from the duties of charity, but on the
contrary commits them even more “to all the works of charity, of mercy, of

81. The spiritual and pastoral riches of Sunday, as they have been handed on to
us by tradition, are truly great. When their significance and implications are
understood in their entirety, Sunday, in a way becomes a synthesis of the
Christian life and a condition for living it well. It is clear therefore why the
observance of the Lord’s Day is so close to the church’s heart and why in the
church’s discipline it remains a real obligation. It is crucially important that
all the faithful should be convinced that they cannot live their faith or share
fully in the life of the Christian community unless they take part regularly in
the Sunday Eucharistic assembly. A particularly efficacious expression of this
is the Sunday gathering of the entire community, obedient to the voice of the
Risen Lord, who calls the faithful together to give them the light of his word
and the nourishment of his body as the perennial sacramental wellspring of
redemption. The grace flowing from this well-spring renews mankind, life and
history.</p>

        <p>82. It is with this strong conviction of faith and with awareness of the
heritage of human values which the observance of Sunday entails that Christians
today must face the enticements of a culture which has accepted the benefits of
rest and free time, but which often uses them frivolously and is at times
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 8650 **** -->attracted by morally questionable forms of entertainment.</p>

      <para xml:id="Ch24.p40">
        <p>84. Sustaining Christian life as it does, Sunday has the additional value of
being a testimony and a proclamation. As a day of prayer, communion and joy,
Sunday resounds throughout society, emanating vital energies and reasons for
hope. Sunday is the proclamation that time, in which he who is the Risen Lord of
history makes his home, is not the grave of our illusions but the cradle of an
ever new future, an opportunity given to us to turn the fleeting moments of this
life into seeds of eternity.

teaching, with the precise goal of recalling certain fundamental truths of
Catholic doctrine which, in the present circumstances, risk being distorted or

itself, which has experienced the spread of numerous doubts and objections of a
human and psychological, social and cultural, religious and even properly
theological nature, with regard to the Church’s moral teachings. It is no longer
a matter of limited and occasional dissent, but of an overall and systematic
calling into question of traditional moral doctrine, on the basis of certain
anthropological and ethical presuppositions”.</p>

rejected; certain of the Church’s moral teachings are found simply unacceptable;
and the Magisterium itself is considered capable of intervening in matters of
morality only in order to “exhort consciences” and to “propose values”, in

“Do not think that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come
not to abolish them but to fulfill.” (Mt 5:17) Christ is the center of the
economy of salvation, the recapitulation of the Old and New Testaments, of the
promises of the law and of their fulfillment in the Gospel; he is the living and
eternal link between the old and the new covenants. There is an Old Testament,
but all truth is in the New Testament, so it is for the law: What was given
through Moses is a figure of the true law. Therefore, the Mosaic law is an image

called. Human freedom and God’s law are not in opposition; on the contrary, they
appeal one to the other. The follower of Christ knows that his vocation is to
freedom. “You are called to freedom, brethren” (Gal 5:13), proclaims the
apostle Paul with joy and pride. But he immediately adds, “Only do not use your
freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love be servants of one

very depths of his being. Being a follower of Christ means becoming conformed to
him who became a servant even to giving himself on the cross (cf. Phil
2:5-8). Christ dwells by faith in the heart of the believer (cf. Eph 3:17), and
thus the disciple is conformed to the Lord. This is the effect of grace, of the
active presence of the Holy Spirit in us. Having become one with Christ, the
Christian
becomes a member of his body, which is the Church (cf. 1 Cor 12:13,27) Sharing

(cf. par. 5. above, St. Alphonsus Maria d’Liguori) called moral theology, a
science which accepts and examines Divine Revelation while at the same time
responding to the demands of human reason. Moral Theology is a reflection
concerned with “morality,” with the good and the evil of human acts and of the
person who performs them. It is also a “theology”, inasmuch as it acknowledges
that the origin and end of moral action are found in the one who “alone is
good” and who, by giving himself to man in Christ, offers him the happiness of
divine life.</p>

such an extent that it becomes an absolute, which would then be the source of
values. This is the direction taken by doctrines which have lost the sense of
the transcendent or which are explicitly atheist. The individual conscience is
accorded the status of a supreme tribunal of moral judgment which hands down
categorical and infallible decisions about good and evil. To the affirmation
that one has a duty to follow one’s conscience is unduly added the affirmation
that one’s moral judgment is true merely by the fact that it has its origin in
the conscience. But in this way the inescapable claims of truth disappear,
yielding their place to a criterion of sincerity, authenticity and “being at

would grant to individuals or social groups the right to determine what is good

unity of his spiritual and biological inclinations and of all the other specific
characteristics necessary for the pursuit of his end. Therefore this law cannot

confronts man with the law and thus becomes a “witness” for man: a witness of
his own faithfulness or unfaithfulness with regard to the law, of his essential
moral rectitude or iniquity. Conscience is the only witness, since what takes
place in the heart of the person is hidden from the eyes of everyone
outside. Conscience makes its witness known only to the person himself. And, in

voice and judgment penetrate the depths of man’s soul, calling him fortiter et
suaviter (strongly and gently) to obedience. ”Moral conscience does not close
man within an insurmountable and impenetrable solitude, but opens him to the

known what man must do or not do, or which assesses an act already performed by
him. It is a judgment which applies to a concrete situation the rational
conviction that one must love and do good and avoid evil. This first principle
of practical reason is part of the natural law. The natural law discloses the
objective and universal demands of the moral good; conscience is the application
of the law to a particular case. Conscience thus formulates moral obligation in
the light of the natural law. The judgment of conscience states “in an ultimate
way” whether a certain particular kind of behavior is in conformity with the
law. (105)</p>

obligation to perform a given act, the link between freedom and truth is made

“decisions.” The maturity and responsibility of these judgments … are not
measured by the liberation of the conscience from objective truth, in favor of

a result of invincible ignorance, although it does not on that account forfeit
its dignity; but this can be said, when a man shows little concern for seeking

against the Good, for or against the Truth and ultimately for or against God.</p>

different from freedom of choice. According to these authors, the key role in
the moral life is to be attributed to a “fundamental option,” brought about by
that fundamental freedom whereby a person makes an overall self-determination,
not through a specific and conscious decision on the level of reflection, but in
a “transcendental way.” The immediate object of such acts would not be
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 8975 **** -->absolute Good but particular goods. A distinction thus comes to be introduced
between the fundamental option and deliberate choices of a concrete kind of

continuation of Jesus’ teaching till the end of time. Jesus said, “I will ask
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9175 **** -->the Father and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever, the
Spirit of truth.” (Jn 14:16) Jesus called the Spirit of truth the Paraclete,
which means “counselor,” also “intercessor” and “advocate.” Jesus himself
is the first Counselor, the Holy Spirit is second. Sent by the Father in Jesus’
name, the Counselor “will teach you all things and remind you of all that [I]
told you.” (Jn 14:26) He will inspire the spreading of the Gospel, help people
understand the correct meaning of the content of Christ’s message, and ensure,
that despite changing conditions and circumstances, the same truth the Apostles
heard is transmitted in its entirety down through the ages. In addition to
“teaching” all things and reminding them of all Jesus said, the Spirit of
truth “will guide you into all truth … and will declare to you the things
that are coming.” (cf. Jn 16:13) What is coming? The scandal of his Cross, his
self-emptying in his Passion and death, everything Christ “did and taught”
that demands faith for acceptance: “this is the work of the Spirit of truth and
the result of his action in man.” In the Upper Room Jesus said to the Apostles:
“It is to your advantage that I go away … but if I go, I will send him [the
Counselor] to you.” What will he do? “He will take what is mine and declare it
to you.” (Jn 16:15)

Holy Spirit.” The words “giving” and “self-giving” are words Jesus spoke in
his farewell address at the Last Supper. They refer to the communion of the
Father, Son and Holy Spirit in the Trinity, to the mystery of Redemption
accomplished by the Son in earthly history, and on Christ’s “departure”
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9200 **** -->through the Cross and Resurrection, transmitting the entire salvific power to
the Holy Spirit: to the one who “will take what is mine.” (Jn 16:14) In the
divine plan, Christ’s “departure” is an indispensable condition for the
“sending” and the coming of the Holy Spirit. “What begins now is the new
salvific self-giving of God, in the Holy Spirit.” God’s original salvific
self-giving was the Spirit of God in creation of the universe, and his
self-communication to man. Christ’s “departure” was the condition for the
“coming” of the Counselor. His “departure” was the price of “the new
beginning.” Sin having entered into creation was “above all in contradiction
to God’s salvific self-communication to man.” “The price of the Cross brings
about the Redemption.” In the power of Christ’s Paschal Mystery “the Holy
Spirit comes in order to remain from the day of Pentecost onwards with the
Apostles, with the Church and in the Church, and through her in the world.”

in the plan of salvation history. They describe how Jesus carries out his
mission as “Messiah” which literally means “Christ,” that is, “Anointed
One,” a name which is distinctive because it means “the one anointed with the
Holy Spirit.” In the house of Cornelius Peter declared, “You must have heard
about the recent happenings in Judea, after the baptism which John preached: how
God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power.” (Acts
10:37ff) The prophet Isaiah predicted this wondrous thing in the Book of Isaiah,
also known as “the Gospel of the Old Testament.” “There shall come forth from
the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots. And the Spirit of
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9225 **** -->the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit
of counsel and power, the spirit of knowledge and fear of the Lord. And his
delight shall be the fear of the Lord.” (Is 11:3)

        <p>16. - 18. The Messiah, the single great personage promised in the Old Covenant,
is anointed by God himself. As the Anointed One he possesses the fullness of the
Spirit of God, and as mediator will grant his Spirit to the whole people. Isaiah
testified to this promise: “The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the
Lord has anointed me to bring good tiding to the afflicted; he has sent me to
bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening
of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of the Lord’s
favor.” (Is 61:1ff) Take note that the Anointed One is also sent: “Now the
Lord God has sent me and his Spirit.” (Is 48:16) Thus, the Messiah comes in the
Holy Spirit, who possesses the fullness of this Spirit in himself and for
others. On Simeon, the aged priest in the Temple, the Holy Spirit “rested” at
the presentation of Jesus in temple. He senses that in this infant would come
“salvation … prepared in the presence of all peoples” at the price of great
suffering, - the Cross - and in which his Mother would be very much a
partner. (cf. Lk 2:25-35) During his visit to the synagogue in his home town,
Nazareth, Jesus attested that the predictions of Isaiah about him have been
fulfilled in him:“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed
me.” After he concluded reading the passage about himself, he said to those
present: “Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.” (cf. Lk
4:16-21)

anointed with the Holy Spirit, and exalted in the Holy Spirit, but most
importantly he is the one who “brings” the Spirit to the Apostles, and not
only to them but “gives” him to the Church after his “departure”as he
promised. How did he do this? He “breathed” on them. The “breath,” the
living God is a supernatural “living breath.” The “breath,” the Holy Spirit,
is proper to the Anointed One; he is a Person-gift. Thus, the trinitarian
mystery comes full circle. The original source (of the gift) is in the Father,
and it is the Son who is “anointed” and “exalted” in the Holy Spirit,
“brings” the Spirit of truth to the Apostles and the Church.

influences, the presence of evil becomes more powerful, and the consequences are
more dire. At the Last Supper, Jesus speaking of the coming of the Advocate
said, “And when he comes he will convict the world in regard to sin and
righteousness and condemnation: sin, because they do not believe in me;
righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see me;
and condemnation, because the ruler of this world has been condemned.” (Jn
16:8-11) Sin “means the rejection of Christ’s mission that will cause people to
condemn him [Jesus] to death.” Righteousness, when “the Father will restore to
Christ” that “definitive justice” in the glory of the Resurrection and
Ascension into heaven. And Judgment “means that the Spirit of truth will show
the guilt of the ’world’ in condemning Jesus to death on the Cross.” The
principal mission of the Holy Spirit, therefore, is “to convince the world
concerning sin,” also “righteousness” and “judgment.”

God, is the principle and root of all the others. Called original sin, it “the
original reality of sin in human history and at the same time in the whole
economy of salvation.” It is known as the “mysterium iniquitatis”, the
mystery of iniquity. Its counter-part is the “mysterium pietatis”, the mystery
of holiness. St. Paul expresses this mystery when he contrasts the
“disobedience” of the first Adam with the “obedience” of Christ. (Rom 5:19;
cf. Phil 2:8) Original disobedience presupposes a rejection, a turning away from
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9300 **** -->the truth of God’s Word. Christ’s sorrow is for those who “do not believe in
him,” those of “non-faith” who succumb easily to the temptations of the
“father of lies.” The personal relationship man has with God who created him
in his “image and likeness” is broken. A call to friendship, a gift of the
Spirit, is ignored or rejected. Thus, it is the Holy Spirit who convinces the
world of sin, of righteousness and condemnation.

        <p>46. The three synoptic evangelizers of the New Testament, Matthew, Mark and Luke
speak of a deeply troubling truth, a sin that is not and will not be
forgiven. It is the sin of blasphemy. Matthew: “whoever speaks against the Holy
Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.” (Mt
12:31ff) Mark: “whoever blasphemies against the Holy Spirit never has
forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin.” (Mk 3:28ff) Luke: “he who
blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.” (Lk 12:10) Question:
because the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is unforgivable, how should
this startling truth be understood? St. Thomas Aquinas explains: the sin of
blasphemy is unforgivable because the means for obtaining forgiveness are
deliberately refused or rejected. Pope John Paul II elaborates on St. Thomas’
explanation: blasphemy is unforgivable because man refuses “to accept the
salvation which God offers through the Holy Spirit who works through the power
of the Cross.” This means man refuses “convincing regarding sin” which comes
from the Holy Spirit. It also means that man rejects the “coming” of the
Counselor, Christ, who through the “redemptive power of his blood,” “purifies
the conscience from dead works.” Lastly blasphemy against the Holy Spirit
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9325 **** -->consists precisely in the radical refusal to accept this forgiveness which he
gives for “genuine conversion” that takes place in the conscience. Blasphemy
against the Holy Spirit, then, is the sin committed by the person who claims to
have a “right” to persist in evil - in any sin at all - and who thus rejects
Redemption. “This is a state of spiritual ruin because blasphemy against the
Holy Spirit does not allow one to escape from one’s self-imposed imprisonment
and open oneself to the divine sources of purification of consciences and of the
remission of sins.”

        <p>47. The action of the Spirit of truth, though its chief aim is salvific, namely
“convincing [people] concerning sin,” it encounters in a person an “interior
resistance.” The conscience seems “impenetrable,” a state of mind that can be
described as “fixed”by reason of free choice. Sacred Scripture calls this
“hardness of heart.” (cf. Ps 81:13; Mk 3:5) In our own time this attitude of
mind and heart is perhaps reflected in the loss of the sense of sin. (cf. John
Paul II, Reconciliatio et Paenitentiae, Reconciliation and Penance, RP, 18) The
Church constantly implores the Lord for the grace of integrity of human
consciences, that they are not lost, and that they maintain a healthy
sensitivity with regard to good and evil. “Integrity” and “sensitivity” of
conscience are qualities intimately connected with the Spirit of truth. Thus,
St. Paul exhorts the Church eloquently and simply, “Do not quench the Spirit,”
(1 Thess 5:10) and “Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God.” (Eph 4:30)

        <p>55. Unfortunately, the history of salvation shows that God’s coming and making
himself close to man, a monumental condescension of the Holy Spirit, meets with
resistance and opposition in our human reality. Thus, when Mary and Joseph
“presented” Jesus in the temple, the prophetic words of Simeon became
true. The new-born Babe of Bethlehem “is set for the rise and fall of many in
Israel, for a sign of contradiction.” (Lk 2:27,34) Opposition to God, who is an
invisible Spirit, originates in the very radical difference of the world which
has “visibility” and “materiality” in contrast to him who is “invisible”
and Absolute Spirit. Conflict and rebellion on the part of man by reason of sin
cause upheaval in the human heart, wherein “the desires of the flesh are
against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh. It is
the Holy Spirit who must convince the world of sin.” (cf. Gal 5:17) Paul makes
a list of the sins of the flesh: “fornication, impurity, licentiousness
… drunkenness, carousing and the like.” These sins are called “carnal.” He
adds others: “enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, party
spirit, envy.” (cf. Gal 5:19-21)These sins are “works of the flesh.” In
contrast to sins and vices, Paul lists virtues called “the fruit of the
Spirit.” They are: love, joy, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
gentleness, self-control. (cf. Gal 5:22ff) Human actions such as these, good and
bad, are obviously in conflict. Thus Paul writes: “If we live by the Spirit,
let us also walk by the Spirit.” (Gal 5:25)

the contrast between “life” and “death.” This is a serious problem, the Holy
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9375 **** -->Father stated, “when materialism is accepted and lived as a system of thought
in all its forms, it means that the acceptance of death is believed to be the
definitive end of human existence.” Everything that is material is corruptible,
and therefore the human body (insofar as it is “animal”) is mortal. If man in
his essence is only “flesh,” death means for him “an impassable frontier and
limit” (uncrossable) Hence one can understand how it can be said that human
life is nothing but an “existence in order to die.” A more colloquial and
fatalistic expression of the same reality is “born to die.”</p>

such as the arms race, nuclear self-destruction, terrorism, organized crime,
poverty and famine, there remains the Christian certainty that the Spirit blows
where he wills, and that we possess “the first fruits of the Spirit.”
Therefore, even though we may be subjected to the sufferings of time that passes
away, “we groan inwardly as we wait for … the redemption of our bodies,”
(cf. Rom 8:23) that is, our human essence which is bodily and spiritual. Though
we groan we are filled with unflagging hope because it is to this human being
that God the Father has come - who is Spirit “sending his own Son in the
likeness of sinful flesh to condemn sin in the flesh.” (cf. Rom 8:3) The
culmination of the Paschal Mystery took place when, after the Resurrection,
Jesus appeared in the midst of the Apostles, breathed on them and said:
“Receive the Holy Spirit.” This “breath” continues forever, for “the Spirit
helps us in our weakness.” (cf. Rom 8:26)

come as Counselor and Spirit of truth. In the context of his mission, the Son
who “had gone away” in the Paschal Mystery, “comes” and is continuously
present in the mystery of the Church. All this happens in a sacramental way
through the power of the Holy Spirit, who, “drawing from the wealth of Christ’s
Redemption,” constantly gives life. As the Church becomes ever more aware of
this mystery, she sees herself more clearly, above all as a “sacrament.”
(cf. LG 9) Christ’s Eucharistic presence, his sacramental way, “I am with
you,” enables the Church to discover ever more deeply her own mystery. This
fundamental mystery is shown in the whole ecclesiology of the Second Vatican
Council, whereby “the Church is in Christ as a sacrament, or a sign and
instrument of the intimate union with God and of the unity of the whole human
race.” (cf. LG 1) As a sacrament, the Church is a development from the Paschal
Mystery of Christ’s “departure”, living by her ever new “coming” by the
power of the Holy Spirit within the same mission of the Paraclete-Spirit of
truth. Precisely this is the essential mystery of the Church, as the Council
professes.

in mind that in the texts of the Council the sacramentality of the Church
appears as distinct from the sacramentality that is proper, in the strict sense,
to the Sacraments. Thus we read: “The Church is … in the nature of a
sacrament - a sign and instrument of communion with God.” But what matters and
what emerges from the analogical sense is the relationship which the Church has
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9425 **** -->with the power of the Holy Spirit, who alone gives life: the Church is the sign
and instrument of the presence and action of the life-giving Spirit. Vatican II
adds that the Church is “a sacrament … of the unity of mankind.” Obviously
it is a question of the unity which the human race - which in itself is
differentiated in various ways - has from God and in God.

<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9450 **** -->now more relevant than ever: “Preaching the Gospel is not a reason for me to
boast; it is a necessity laid on me: woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel!”

her own teaching, nonetheless often reflect a ray of that truth which enlightens
all men.” (4) Continuing in this line of thought, the Church proclaims Jesus
Christ, “the way, the truth and the life” (Jn 14:6), and today makes use of
the practice of inter-religious dialogue. Inter-religious dialogue, which is

Jesus perfected revelation by fulfilling it through his whole work of making

made flesh, in his entire mystery, who moves from incarnation to glorification,
is the source, participated but real, as well as the fulfillment of every
salvific revelation of God to humanity, and that the Holy Spirit, who is

must be firmly held. This distinction is not always born in mind in current
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9525 **** -->theological reflection. Thus, theological faith (the acceptance of the truth
revealed by the One and Triune God) is often identified with belief in other
religions, which is religious experience still in search of the absolute truth
and still lacking assent to God who reveals himself. This is one of the reasons

other revelatory and salvific figures. The infinite, the Absolute, the Ultimate
Mystery of God would thus manifest itself to humanity in many ways and in many
historical figures: Jesus of Nazareth would be one of these. More concretely,

        <p>1 and 2. Suffering is a human reality that reaches everyone in one form or
another and excludes no one. It makes no distinctions between young and old,
children and adults, Christians and non-Christians, believers and
non-believers. To acknowledge this reality is not being morbid or
depressive. Rather, developing a right attitude toward suffering is the way to
go. Attitude spans a range of emotions, everything from peaceful acceptance of
and resignation to suffering to subliminal joy in the benefits it brings to
oneself and others when properly understood and accepted. St. Paul gives a hint
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9650 **** -->that in suffering lie both joy to oneself and benefits to others.
Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake.“ (Col 1:24, itals added) ”In my
flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for the sake of his
body, that is, the Church.“ (ibid.)
Suffering and salvation are linked inseparably because it was through suffering
that Christ brought about man’s Redemption. ”What we express by the word
“suffering’ seems to be particularly essential to the nature of man. Suffering
seems to belong to man’s transcendence, that is, necessary for man to rise to
the higher levels of his being. Man is ’destined’ to go beyond himself in a
mysterious way.”

        <p>4. Reflecting on the mystery: “human suffering evokes compassion, also
respect, and it also intimidates.” The way to deal with every form of human
suffering involves the deepest need of the heart and the imperative of
faith. The “need of the heart” is how to overcome fear, cope with anger, and
disallow oneself to get trapped in resentment, loss of hope and the temptation
to depression and despair. The single, solid and most fundamental “need of the
heart” is “the imperative of faith.” St. Paul says that individual suffering
has a salvific effect for the good of the whole Mystical Body, the Church: “In
my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for the sake of his
body, which is the Church.” (Col 1:24)

        <p>5. - 7. Human suffering is an “objective reality,” an explicit problem that
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9675 **** -->raises difficult questions and demands satisfying answers. Despite the progress
of science and medicine to cure many illnesses that afflict the body, moral
suffering, the “pain of the soul,” is far more difficult to diagnose and
heal. All 36 books of the Old Testament, it can be said, is a history of
suffering, psychological and physical, a book of the history of man who
experiences every kind of evil and suffering. This prompts the question, what is
evil? Some explain suffering as a consequence of evil which exists and comes in
numerous ways. The Christian explanation of evil starts with the positive: all
existence is good and all that exists is good because of the goodness of God,
its Creator. Good proclaims God’s goodness. Evil is “a certain lack, limitation
or distortion of good.” Man suffers because he no longer shares in that good,
is cut off from it, or deprived of it, when he ’ought’—in the normal order of
things—share in this good, but does not. Thus evil is a depravation of good
that causes suffering.

        <p>9. - 11. The attempt to explain evil which brings suffering as “the depravation
of good,” though true, is seen as inadequate and simplistic. Two question arise
“Why and what is its meaning?” Both questions are difficult. The human cry is
pathetic: “God, why?” “Lord, why me?” Frustration in suffering often leads
to an angry denial of God, or his goodness, depression over what one feels is
“undeserved suffering,” or is punishment for faults and sins. The meaning of
suffering clearly is complex. The importance of the question of the meaning of
suffering demands an answer. In the book of Job in the Old Testament not only is
the question of suffering raised but the explanation is given. Without any fault
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9700 **** -->of his own Job was struck with horrible suffering: he lost all his possessions,
his sons and daughters, and finally was afflicted with grave illness. The common
thought was, he must have done something terribly wrong, or he is punished for
some terrible crime or sin. As Lawgiver and Judge, God, the Creator, has been
offended by a transgression of his law. Good must be rewarded, the moral evil of
sin must be punished. This is true. However, in Job’s case another principle is
at work. God himself “recognizes that Job is not guilty. His suffering is the
suffering of someone who is innocent.” Therefore suffering must be looked upon
as a mystery that is not penetrable completely by one’s own intelligence. The
introduction of the book makes clear that God permitted Satan to provoke Job as
a “testing” of his “righteousness.” As a matter of fact God did this “to
demonstrate Job’s righteousness.” Suffering, then, has the nature of a
“test.” Moreover, Job’s suffering in innocence is a foretelling of the passion
of Christ.

        <p>12. and 13. The answer to “why” suffering strikes the innocent is that it has
an “educational value.” In suffering God offers the suffering person an
“invitation of his mercy … in order to lead to conversion.” “It also
creates the possibility of rebuilding goodness in the person who suffers.” As
this was true of the people in the Old Testament, it is true and extremely
important above all for God’s People in the New Covenant. Suffering must serve
for conversion, that is, for the rebuilding of goodness in the subject, who can
recognize the divine mercy in this call to repentance. Suffering has many
aspects not only in “the transcendent order of justice,” but also “insofar as
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9725 **** -->it illuminates the order with Love.” Love is the fullest answer to the question
of the “why” of suffering, demonstrated dramatically to man “in the cross of
Jesus Christ.”

we share in Christ’s suffering? “In the cross of Christ not only is the
Redemption accomplished through suffering, but also human suffering itself has
been redeemed.” Without any fault of his own, Christ took on Himself “the
total evil of sin.” Christ experiencing “total evil,” the magnitude of which
is unimaginable, became the price of the Redemption. The Apostle Peter writes,
“you know that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your
fathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the
precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot” (1 Pet
1:18-10) St. Paul makes two statements on our Redemption: “He gave himself for
our sins to deliver us from the present evil age;” (Gal 1:4) and “You were
bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.” (1 Cor 6:20) Every man,
therefore, has his own share in the Redemption. “Each one is also called to
share in that suffering through which the Redemption was accomplished.” “In
bringing about the Redemption through suffering, Christ has also raised human
suffering to the level of the Redemption.” Thus, each person, in his suffering,
can also become a sharer in the redemptive suffering of Christ. How? “Because
Christ has opened his suffering to man, and through his redemptive suffering he
is in a certain sense a sharer in human sufferings. Man discovers this profound
truth through faith, and through his faith he rediscovers the content and
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9750 **** -->meaning of sharing in the suffering of Christ.”

        <p>21. and 22. Human suffering is not and ought not be looked upon as gloom and
darkness. Following the cross of suffering is the joy of the resurrection. Every
follower of Christ must walk the path of the Paschal mystery. Those who
witnessed Christ’s cross and resurrection were convinced that “through many
tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.” (cf. Acts 14:22) Clearly
suffering is the price of glory in the kingdom of God. Uniting suffering with
the mystery of Christ’s Redemption gives maturity enough to enter the
kingdom. The prospect of glory in the kingdom gives hope for attaining that
glory. To the Romans, Paul writes: “We are … joint heirs with Christ, if only
we suffer with him so that we also may be glorified with him. I consider that
the sufferings of this present time are as nothing compared with the glory to be
revealed for us.”(Rom 8:16-18) To human eyes Christ’s humiliation on the cross
was his emptying of himself, but in the eyes of God it was his being lifted
up. “In weakness Christ manifested his power, and in humiliation he manifested
all his messianic greatness. Human suffering is God’s invitation to manifest the
greatness of man, his spiritual maturity.” This maturity in the faith is
manifested not only in martyrs and confessors but “in many others” who give
their lives for the truth, a just cause or a painful personal affliction.

        <p>23. Suffering is always a trial. At times some trials are very hard to bear. In
his second letter to the Corinthians Paul “begged the Lord” about a certain
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9775 **** -->weakness he was given that it might leave him. But the Lord’s answer to Paul
was, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.”

        <p>Writing to the Romans Paul speaks of certain persons who are given a
“particular vocation,” a call, to share in Christ’s sufferings. “Not only
that, but we can even boast of our afflictions, knowing that affliction produces
endurance, and endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope, and hope
does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts
through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.”(5.3-5) This kind of
suffering is a special call of holiness.

        <p>24. The final stage of the spiritual journey in relation to suffering is to be
able to do what St. Paul said to the Colossians: “Now I rejoice in my
sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in the
afflictions of Christ on behalf of his body, which is the Church.” (1.24) Does
this mean that Christ’s redemption of man is not fully accomplished, and that
the loving sufferings of man somehow complete in the body of Christ what is not
completed in Christ’s redemption of man? NO! It means 1) that in the Paschal
Mystery Christ began a union with men that became the community of the Church;
2) through the act of Baptism that “configures” man to Christ, and
sacramentally through the Eucharist, the Church is continually being built up
spiritually as the Body of Christ; and 3) in this Body, the community of
baptized and eucharistically nourished men, Christ wishes to be united with
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9800 **** -->every individual, and in a special way he is united with those who suffer.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch28.p13">
        <p>Therefore, whoever suffers “tribulations” in union with Christ not only
receives strength to do so, but also “completes” by his sufferings what is
lacking in Christ’s afflictions for the sake of his body, the Mystical Body, the
Church. Human suffering has a “creative character.” No man can add anything to
Christ’s “infinite and inexhaustible” good of Redemption. But in the mystery
of the Church as his Body, Christ has in a sense opened his own redemptive
suffering to all human suffering. Thus, suffering man anywhere in the world
becomes a sharer in Christ’s suffering, and in his own way completes the
suffering through which Christ accomplished the Redemption of the world. No,
this does not mean that Christ’s Redemption is incomplete. It means that Christ,
who accomplished Redemption through “satisfactory love,” is open to all love
expressed in human suffering. Because there is no limit to the dimension of
love, Christ does not bring love to a close. It is every human suffering, by
reason of loving union with Christ, that completes the suffering of Christ. It
is through the suffering Church that Christ completes his redemptive work.

Encyclical Letter, in continuity with the Jubilee heritage I have left to the
Church in the Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte and its Marian crowning,
Rosarium Virginis Mariae. To contemplate Christ involves being able to recognize
him wherever he manifests himself, in his many forms of presence, but above all
in the living sacrament of his body and blood. The Church draws her life from
Christ in the Eucharist; by him she is fed and by him she is enlightened. The
Eucharist is both a mystery of faith and a “mystery of light.”Whenever the
Church celebrates the Eucharist, the faithful can in some way relive the
experience of the two disciples on the road to Emmaus: “their eyes were opened

places the practice of Eucharistic adoration has been almost completely
abandoned. In various parts of the Church abuses have occurred, leading to
confusion with regard to sound faith and Catholic doctrine concerning this
wonderful sacrament. At times one encounters an extremely reductive
understanding of the Eucharistic mystery. Stripped of its sacrificial meaning,
it is celebrated as if it were simply a fraternal banquet. Furthermore, the
necessity of the ministerial priesthood, grounded in apostolic succession, is at
times obscured and the sacramental nature of the Eucharist is reduced to its
mere effectiveness as a form of proclamation. This has led here and there to
ecumenical initiatives which, albeit well-intentioned, indulge in Eucharistic
practices contrary to the discipline by which the Church expresses her
faith. How can we not express profound grief at all this? The Eucharist is too

expressed its sacrificial meaning and made sacramentally present his sacrifice

sacrificial nature of the Eucharistic mystery cannot therefore be understood as
something separate, independent of the Cross or only indirectly referring to the
sacrifice of Calvary.</p>

        <p>13. By virtue of its close relationship to the sacrifice of Golgatha, the
Eucharist is a sacrifice in the strict sense, and not in a general way, as if it
were simply a matter of Christ’s offering himself to the faithful as their
spiritual food. The gift of his love and obedience to the point of giving his
life (cf. Jn 10:17-18) is first and foremost a gift to the Father. (cf. RH,20)</p>

and blood are received in communion. We are reminded of his words: “As the
living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats me will
live because of me.” (Jn 6:57) The Eucharist is a true banquet, in which Christ
offers himself as our nourishment. This is no metaphorical food: “My flesh is

Eucharist is also the fact that it spurs us on our journey through history and
plants a seed of living hope in our daily commitment to the work before
us. Certainly the Christian vision leads to the expectation of “new heavens”
and “a new earth” (Rev 21:1), but this increases, rather than lessens, our
sense of responsibility for the world today. (cf. GS,39) I wish to reaffirm
this forcefully at the beginning of the new millennium, so that Christians will
feel more obliged than ever not to neglect their duties as citizens in this
world. Theirs is the task of contributing with the light of the Gospel to the
building of a more human world, a world fully in harmony with God’s plan.</p>

        <p>Chapter Two: The Eucharist Builds the Church
21. The Second Vatican Council teaches that the celebration of the Eucharist is
the center of the process of the Church’s growth. After stating that “the
Church, as the Kingdom of Christ already present in mystery, grows visibly in
the world through the power of God,” then, as if in answer to the question:
“How does the Church grow?”, the Council adds: as often as the sacrifice of
the Cross by which “Christ our pasch is sacrificed” (1 Cor 5:7) is celebrated
on the altar, the work of our redemption is carried out. At the same time in the
sacrament of the Eucharistic bread, the unity of the faithful, who form one body
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 9975 **** -->in Christ (cf. 1 Cor 10:17), is both expressed and brought about.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch29.p21">
        <p>A causal influence of the Eucharist is present at the Church’s very origins. The
Evangelists specify that it was the Twelve, the Apostles, who gathered with
Jesus at the Last Supper (cf. Mt 26:20; Mk 14:17; Lk 22:14) This is a detail of
notable importance, for the Apostles “were the seeds of the new Israel and the
beginning of the sacred hierarchy.”</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch29.p22">
        <p>The Apostles, by accepting in the Upper Room Jesus’ invitation: “Take, eat”,
“Drink of it, all of you” (Mt 26:26-27), entered for the first time into
sacramental communion with him. From that time forward, until the end of the
age, the Church is built up through sacramental communion with the Son of God
who was sacrificed for our sake: “Do this in remembrance of me…Do this, as
often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” (I Cor 11.24-25; cf. Lk 22:19)</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch29.p23">
        <p>23. Eucharistic communion also confirms the Church in her unity as the body of
Christ. Saint Paul refers to this unifying power of participation in the banquet
of the Eucharist when he writes to the Corinthians: “The bread which we break,
is it not a communion in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who
are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.” (1 Cor 10:16-17)</p>

        <p>24. The gift of Christ and his Spirit which we receive in Eucharistic communion
superabundantly fulfills the yearning for fraternal unity deeply rooted in the
human heart; at the same time it elevates the experience of fraternity already
present in our common sharing at the same Eucharistic table to a degree which
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10000 **** -->far surpasses that of the simple human experience of sharing a meal. Through her
communion with the body of Christ the Church comes to be ever more profoundly
“in Christ in the nature of a sacrament, that is, a sign and instrument of
intimate unity with God and of the unity of the whole human race”. (LG,1)</p>

      <para xml:id="Ch29.p25">

        <p>25. The worship of the Eucharist outside of the Mass is of inestimable value for
the life of the Church. This worship is strictly linked to the celebration of
the Eucharistic Sacrifice. The presence of Christ under the sacred species
reserved after Mass … derives from the celebration of the sacrifice and is
directed towards communion, both sacramental and spiritual. It is the
responsibility of Pastors to encourage, also by their personal witness, the
practice of Eucharistic adoration, and exposition of the Blessed Sacrament in
particular, as well as prayer of adoration before Christ present under the
Eucharistic species.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch29.p27">
        <p>Particularly outstanding in this regard was Saint Alphonsus Liguori who wrote:
“Of all devotions, that of adoring Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament is the
greatest after the sacraments, the one dearest to God and one most helpful to
us.” The Eucharist is a priceless treasure: by not only celebrating it but
also by praying before it outside of Mass we are enabled to make contact with
the very wellspring of grace.

        <p>Chapter Three: The Apostolicity of the Eucharist and of the Church
30. The Catholic Church’s teaching on the relationship between priestly ministry
and the Eucharist and her teaching on the Eucharistic Sacrifice have both been
the subject in recent decades of a fruitful dialogue in the area of
ecumenism. We must give thanks to the Blessed Trinity for the significant
progress and convergence achieved in this regard, which lead us to hope one day
for a full sharing of faith. Nonetheless, the observations of the Council
concerning Ecclesial Communities which arose in the West from the sixteenth
century onwards and are separated from the Catholic Church remain fully
pertinent: “The Ecclesial Communities separated from us lack that fullness of
unity with us which should flow from Baptism, and we believe that especially
because of the lack of the sacrament of Orders they have not preserved the
genuine and total reality of the Eucharistic mystery. Nevertheless, when they
commemorate the Lord’s death and resurrection in the Holy Supper, they profess
that it signifies life in communion with Christ and they await his coming in
glory.” (UR,22)</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch29.p29">
        <p>The Catholic faithful, therefore, while respecting the religious convictions of
these separated brethren, must refrain from receiving the communion distributed
in their celebrations, so as not to condone an ambiguity about the nature of the
Eucharist and, consequently, to fail in their duty to bear witness to the
truth. Similarly, it is unthinkable to substitute for Sunday Mass ecumenical
celebrations of the word or services of common prayer with Christians from the
aforementioned Ecclesial Communities, or even participation in their own
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10050 **** -->liturgical services. Such celebrations and services, however praiseworthy in
certain situations, prepare for the goal of full communion, including
Eucharistic communion, but they cannot replace it.</p>
      </para>

        <p>31. We can understand, then, how important it is for the spiritual life of the
priest, as well as for the good of the Church and the world, that priest follow
the Council’s recommendation to celebrate the Eucharist daily: “for even if the
faithful are unable to be present, it is an action of Christ and the Church.”</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch29.p31">
        <p>The centrality of the Eucharist in the life and ministry of priests is the basis
of its centrality in the pastoral promotion of priestly vocations. It is in the
Eucharist that prayer for vocations is most closely united to the prayer of
Christ the Eternal High Priest. At the same time the diligence of priests
carrying out their Eucharistic ministry, together with the conscious, active and
fruitful participation of the faithful in the Eucharist, provides young men with
a powerful example of a priest’s fervent pastoral charity which the Lord uses to
sow and to bring to fruition in a young man’s heart the seed of a priestly
calling.</p>

        <p>33. When, due to the scarcity of priests, non-ordained members of the faithful
are entrusted with a share in the pastoral care of a parish, they should bear in
mind that–as the Second Vatican Council teaches–“no Christian community can
be built up unless it has its basis and center in the celebration of the most
Holy Eucharist”. (P0,6) They have a responsibility, therefore, to keep alive in
the community a genuine “hunger” for the Eucharist, so that no opportunity for
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10075 **** -->the celebration of Mass will ever be missed, also taking advantage of the
occasional presence of a priest who is not impeded by Church law for celebrating
Mass.</p>

        <p>34. The Extraordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in 1985 saw in the
concept of an “ecclesiology of communion” the central and fundamental idea of
the documents of the Second Vatican Council. The Church is called during her
earthly pilgrimage to maintain and promote communion with the Triune God and
communion among the faithful. For this purpose she possesses the word and the
sacraments, particularly the Eucharist, by which she “constantly lives and
grows” (LG,26) and in which she expresses her very nature. It is not by chance
that the term communion has become one of the names given to this sublime
sacrament.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch29.p35">
        <p>35. The celebration of the Eucharist, however, cannot be the starting-point for
communion; it presupposes that communion already exists, a communion which it
seeks to consolidate and bring to perfection. The sacrament is an expression of
this bond of communion both in its invisible dimension, which, in Christ and
through the working of the Holy Spirit, unites us to the Father and among
ourselves, and in its visible dimension, which entails communion in the teaching
of the Apostles, in the sacraments and in the Church’s hierarchical order. The
profound relationship between the invisible and the visible elements of
ecclesial communion is constitutive of the Church as the sacrament of
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10100 **** -->salvation. (Author’s note: regarding the term “communion” see also Part I,
Stage 4, Home Visitation and Evangelization for Community Building)</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch29.p36">
        <p>38. Ecclesial communion, as I have said, is likewise visible (cf. par. 35), and
finds expression in a series of “bonds” listed by the Council when it teaches:
“They are fully incorporated into the society of the Church who, possessing the
Spirit of Christ, accept her whole structure and all the means of salvation
established within her, and within her visible framework are tinted to Christ,
who governs her through the Supreme Pontiff and the Bishops, by the bonds of
profession of faith, the sacraments, ecclesiastical government and communion.”(LG,14)</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch29.p37">
        <p>The Eucharist, as the supreme sacramental manifestation of communion in the
Church, demands to be celebrated in a context where the outward bonds of
communion are also intact. It is not possible to give communion to a person who
is not baptized or to one who rejects the full truth of the faith regarding the
Eucharistic mystery. Christ is the truth and he bears witness to the
truth. (cf. Jn 14:6; 18:37); the sacrament of his body and blood does not permit
duplicity.</p>

        <p>41. The Eucharist’s particular effectiveness in promoting communion is one of
the reasons for the importance of Sunday Mass. I have already dwelt on this and
on the other reasons which make Sunday Mass fundamental for the life of the
Church and of individual believers in my Apostolic Letter on the sanctification
of Sunday, Dies Domini. (Author’s note: Sunday, Dies Domini, is treated in two
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10125 **** -->places in the CLCC process, in Part I, Stage 5, Stewards of the Eucharist; and

the apt expression and unsurpassabale source of that unity.</p>

      <para xml:id="Ch29.p40">
        <p>44. Precisely because the Church’s unity, which the Eucharist brings about
through the Lord’s sacrifice and by communion in his body and blood, absolutely
requires full communion in the bonds of the profession of faith, the sacraments
and ecclesiastical governance, it is not possible to celebrate together the same
Eucharistic liturgy until those bonds are fully re-established. Any such
celebration would not be a valid means, and might well prove instead to be an
obstacle, to the attainment of full communion.</p>

        <p>Chapter Five: The Dignity of the Eucharistic Celebration
48. Like the woman who anointed Jesus in Bethany, the Church has feared no
“extravagance”, devoting the best of her resources to expressing her wonder
and adoration before the unsurpassable gift of the Eucharist. No less than the
first disciples charged with preparing the “large upper room”, she felt the
need, down the centuries and in her encounters with different cultures, to
celebrate the Eucharist in a setting worthy of so great a mystery. In the wake
of Jesus’ own words and actions, and building upon the rich heritage of Judaism,
the Christian liturgy was born. Could there ever be an adequate means of
expressing the acceptance of that self-gift which the Divine Bridegroom
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10150 **** -->continually makes to his Bride, the Church, by bringing the Sacrifice offered
once and for all on the Cross to successive generations of believers and thus
becoming nourishment for all the faithful? Though the idea of a “banquet”
naturally suggests familiarity, the Church has never yielded to the temptation
to trivialize this “intimacy” with her Spouse by forgetting that he is also
her Lord and that the “banquet” always remains a sacrificial banquet marked by
the blood shed on Golgatha. The Eucharistic Banquet is truly a “sacred”
banquet, in which the simplicity of the signs conceals the unfathomable holiness
of God: O sacrum conviviurn, in quo Christus sumitur! The bread which is broken
on our altars, offered to us as wayfarers along the paths of the world, is panis
angelorurn, the bread of angels, which cannot be approached except with the
humility of the centurion in the Gospel, “Lord, I am not worthy to have you
come under my roof.” (Mt 8:8; Lk:7.6)</p>

        <p>49. With this heightened sense of mystery, we understand how the faith of the
Church in the mystery of the Eucharist has found historical expression not only
in the demand for interior disposition of devotion, but also in outward forms
meant to evoke and emphasize the grandeur of the event being celebrated. This
led progressively to the development of a particular form of regulating the
Eucharistic liturgy, with due respect for the various legitimately constituted
ecclesial traditions. On this foundation a rich artistic heritage also
developed. Architecture, sculpture, painting and music, moved by the Christian
mystery, have found in the Eucharist, both directly and indirectly, a source of
great inspiration.</p>

Peter, the Bishop of Rome, whom God established as her “perpetual and visible
principle and foundation of unity”, and whom the Spirit sustains in order that

expression of Pope St. Gregory the Great, my ministry is that of servus servorum

from ministry. The Catholic Church’s conviction that in the ministry of the
Bishop of Rome, she has preserved, in fidelity to the Apostolic Tradition and
the faith of the Fathers, the visible sign and guarantor of unity, constitutes a

in following Jesus, and it is at Rome that he gives his greatest proof of love

that the communion of the particular Churches with the Church of Rome, and of
their Bishops with the Bishop of Rome, is–in God’s plan–an essential requisite
for full and visible communion. For attaining full communion, the Eucharist is
the highest sacramental manifestation that needs to be visibly expressed in a
ministry in which all the Bishops recognize that they are united in Christ and
all the faithful find confirmation for their faith. This function of Peter must
continue in the church so that under her sole Head, who is Jesus Christ, she may

strongly emphasized that at times we run the risk of forgetting that in the mind
of the Evangelist, unity is above all for the glory of the Father. At the same
time it is obvious that the lack of unity among Christians contradicts the Truth
which Christians have the mission to spread and, consequently, it damages
their witness. At this point we wish to emphasize the sign of unity among all

great trust in her. For it must be recognized that before anyone else it was God
himself, the Eternal Father, who entrusted himself to the Virgin of Nazareth,
giving her his own Son in the mystery of the Incarnation. The words “Behold, I

        <p>Mary in the Life of the Church and of Every Christian
42. Linking itself with Tradition, the Second Vatican Council brought new light
to bear on the role of the Mother of Christ in the life of the Church. “Through
the gift … of divine motherhood, Mary is united with her Son, the Redeemer,
and with his singular graces and offices. By these the Blessed Virgin is also
intimately united with the Church: the Mother of God is a figure of the Church
in the matter of faith, charity and perfect union with Christ.”(ibid. 63) (117)</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p18">
        <p>Mary believed in the fulfilment of what had been said to her by the Lord. As
handmaid of the Lord, she remained in perfect fidelity to the person and mission
of this Son. As Mother, “believing and obeying … she brought forth on earth
the Father’s Son. This she did, knowing not man but overshadowed by the Holy
Spirit.”(118)</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p19">
        <p>For these reasons Mary is honored in the Church with special reverence. Indeed,
from most ancient times, the Blessed Virgin Mary has been venerated under the
title of “God bearer.” In all perils and needs, the faithful have fled
prayerfully to her protection.(119) This cult is altogether special: It bears in
itself and expresses the profound link which exists between the mother of Christ
and the Church. As Virgin and Mother, Mary remains for the Church(120) “a
permanent model.” It can therefore be said that especially under this aspect,
namely as model, or rather as a “figure,” Mary, present in the mystery of
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10725 **** -->Christ, remains constantly present also in the mystery of the Church. For the
Church, too, is “called mother and virgin,” and these names have a profound
biblical and theological justification.(121)</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p20">
        <p>43. The Church “becomes herself a mother by accepting God’s word with
fidelity. (122) Like Mary, who first believed by accepting the word of God
revealed to her at the Annunciation and by remaining faithful to that word in
all her trials even unto the Cross, so too the Church becomes a mother when,
accepting with fidelity the Word of God,(123) by her preaching and by baptism
she brings forth to a new and immortal life children who are conceived of the
Holy Spirit and born of God.” This maternal characteristic of the Church was
expressed in a particularly vivid way by the Apostle to the Gentiles when he
wrote: “My little children, with whom I am again in travail until Christ be
formed in you!” (Gal 4:19) These words of St. Paul contain an interesting sign
of the early church’s awareness of her own motherhood, linked to her apostolic
service to mankind. This awareness enabled and still enables the Church to see
her life and mission modeled upon the example of the Mother of the Son,who is
“the first-born among many brethren.” (Rom 8:29)</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p21">
        <p>If the Church is the sign and instrument of intimate union with God, she is so
by reason of her motherhood, because, receiving life from the Spirit, she
“generates” sons and daughters of the human race to a new life in Christ. For,
just as Mary is at the service of the mystery of the incarnation, so the Church
is always at the service of the mystery of adoption to sonship through grace.</p>
      </para>
      <!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10750 **** -->
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p22">
        <p>Likewise, following the example of Mary, the Church remains the virgin faithful
to her spouse: “The Church herself is a virgin, who keeps whole and pure the
fidelity she has pledged to her spouse.”(125) For the Church is the spouse of
Christ, as is clear from the Pauline Letters
(cf. Eph 5:21-33; 2 Cor 11:2), and from the title found in John: “bride of the
Lamb.” (Rev 21:9) If the Church as spouse “keeps the fidelity she has pledged
to Christ,” this fidelity, even though in the Apostle’s teaching it has become
an image of marriage (cf. Eph 5:23-33), also has value as a model of total
self-giving to God in celibacy “for the kingdom of heaven,” in virginity
consecrated to God (cf. Mt 19:11-12; 2 Cor 11:2) Precisely such virginity, after
the example of the Virgin of Nazareth, is the source of a special fruitfulness:
It is the source of motherhood in the Holy Spirit.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p23">
        <p>44. Mary is thus present in the mystery of the Church as a model. But the
Church’s mystery also consists in generating people to a new and immortal life:
this is her motherhood in the Holy Spirit. And here Mary is not only the model
and figure of the Church; she is much more. For, “with material love, she
cooperates in the birth and development of sons and daughters of Mother
Church.” The Church’s motherhood is accomplished not only according to the
model and figure of the Mother of God, but also by her “cooperation.” The
Church draws abundantly from this cooperation, that is to say, from the maternal
mediation which is characteristic of Mary, insofar as already on earth she
cooperated in the rebirth and development of the Church’s sons and daughters, as
the Mother of that Son whom the Father “placed as the first-born among many
brethren.”(128) She cooperated, as the Second Vatican Council teaches, with a
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10775 **** -->maternal love.
(129) Here we perceive the real value of the words spoken by Jesus to his Mother
at the hour of the Cross: “Woman, behold your son” and to the disciple:
“Behold your mother.” (Jn 19:26-27) They are words which determine Mary’s
place in the life of Christ’s disciples and they express–as I have already
said–the new motherhood of the Mother of the Redeemer: a spiritual motherhood
born from the heart of the Paschal Mystery of the Redeemer of the world. It is a
motherhood in the order of grace, for it implores the gift of the Spirit, who
raises up the new children of God, redeems through the sacrifice of Christ: that
Spirit who Mary too, together with the Church, received on the day of Pentecost.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p24">
        <p>Her motherhood is particularly noted and experienced by the Christian people at
the Sacred Banquet–the liturgical celebration of the mystery of the
Redemption–at which Christ, his true body born of the Virgin Mary, becomes
present.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p25">
        <p>The piety of the Christian people has always very rightly sensed a profound link
between devotion to the Blessed Virgin and worship of the Eucharist: this is a
fact that can be seen in the liturgy of both the West and the East, in the
traditions of the religious families, in the modem movements of spirituality,
including those for youth, and in the pastoral practice of the Marian
Shrines. Mary guides the faithful to the Eucharist.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p26">
        <p>45. Of the essence of motherhood is the fact that it concerns the
person. Motherhood always establishes a unique and unrepeatable relationship
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10800 **** -->between two people: between mother and child and between child and mother. It
can be said that motherhood “in the order of grace” preserves the analogy with
what “in the order of nature” characterizes the union between mother and
child. In light of this fact, it becomes easier to understand why in Christ’s
testament on Golgotha his Mother’s new motherhood is expressed in the singular,
in reference to one man: “Behold your son.”</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p27">
        <p>It can also be said that these same words fully show the reason for the Marian
dimension of the life of Christ’s disciples. This is true not only of John, who
at that hour stood at the foot of the Cross together with his Master’s Mother,
but it is also true of every disciple of Christ, of every Christian. The
Redeemer entrusts his mother to the disciple, and at the same time he gives her
to him as his mother. Mary’s motherhood, which becomes man’s inheritance, is a
gift: a gift which Christ himself makes personally to every individual. At the
foot of the Cross, there begins that special entrusting of humanity to the
Mother of Christ, which in the history of the Church has been practiced and
expressed in different ways. The Apostle and Evangelist said: “And from that
hour the disciple took her to his own home.” (Jn 19:27)</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p28">
        <p>This statement certainly means that the role of son was attributed to the
disciple and that he assumed responsibility for the mother of his beloved
Master. And since Mary was given as a mother to him personally, the statement
indicates, even though indirectly, everything expressed by the intimate
relationship of a child with its mother. And all of this can be included in the
word “entrusting.” Such entrusting is the response to a person’s love, and in
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10825 **** -->particular to the love of a mother.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p29">
        <p>46. This filial relationship, this self-entrusting of a child to its mother, not
only has its beginning in Christ, but can also be said to be definitively
directed towards him. Mary can be said to continue to say to each individual the
words which she spoke at Cana in Galilee: “Do whatever he tells you.” For he,
Christ, is the one mediator between God and mankind; he is the way, the truth,
and the life (Jn 14:6); it is he whom the Father has given to the world, so that
man “should not perish but have eternal life.” (Jn 3:16)</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p30">
        <p>The Virgin of Nazareth became the first witness of this saving love of the
Father, and she also wishes to remain its humble handmaid always and
everywhere. For every Christian, for every human being, Mary is the one who
first “believed,” and precisely with her faith as Spouse and Mother she wishes
to act upon all those who entrust themselves to her as her children. And it is
well known that the more her children persevere and progress in this attitude,
the nearer Mary leads them to the “unsearchable riches of Christ.” (Eph 3:8)
And to the same degree they recognize more and more clearly the dignity of man
in all its fullness and the definitive meaning of his vocation, for “Christ
… fully reveals man to man himself”(GS,22)(133)</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p31">
        <p>47. At the Council, Paul VI solemnly proclaimed that Mary is the Mother of the
Church, “that is, mother of the entire Christian people, both faithful and
pastors.” (134) Later, in 1968, in the Profession of Faith known as “Credo of
the People of God,” he restated this truth in an even more forceful way: “We
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10850 **** -->believe that the Most Holy Mother of God, the New Eve, the Mother of the Church,
carries on in heaven her maternal role with regard to the members of Christ,
cooperating in the birth and development of divine life in the souls of the
redeemed.” (135)</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p32">
        <p>The Council’s teaching emphasized that the truth concerning the Blessed Virgin,
Mother of Christ, is an effective aid in exploring more deeply the truth
concerning the Church. When speaking of the Dogmatic Constitution, Lumen
Gentium, which had just been approved by the Council, Paul said: “Knowledge of
the true Catholic doctrine regarding the Blessed Virgin Mary will always be a
key to the exact understanding of the mystery of Christ and of the
Church.” (136)</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p33">
        <p>Mary is present in the Church as the Mother of Christ, and at the same time as
that mother whom Christ, in the mystery of the Redemption, gave to humanity in
the person of the Apostle John. Thus, in her new motherhood in the Spirit, Mary
embraces each and everyone in the Church, and embraces each and everyone through
the Church. In this sense Mary, Mother of the Church, is also the Church’s
model. Indeed, as Paul VI hopes and asks, the Church must draw “from the Virgin
Mother of God the most authentic form of perfect imitation of Christ.”(137)</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch32.p34">
        <p>Thanks to this special bond linking the Mother of Christ with the Church there
is further clarified the mystery of that “woman” who, from the first chapters
of the book of Genesis until the book of Revelation, accompanies the revelation
of God’s salvific plan for humanity. For Mary, present in the Church as the
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10875 **** -->Mother of the Redeemer, takes part, as a mother, in that “monumental struggle;
against the powers of darkness”(138) which continues throughout human
history. By her ecclesial identification, Mary is “the woman clothed with the
sun.” (Rev 12:1) (139) Hence, as Christians raise their eyes with faith to Mary
in the course of their earthly pilgrimage, they “strive to increase in
holiness.”(140) Mary, the exalted daughter of Sion, helps all her children,
wherever they may be and whatever their condition, to find in Christ the path to
the Father’s house.</p>

      <p>Q. Why do you call Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian (CLCC) a process and

    </para>
    <para xml:id="A1.p2">
      <p>A. A process is developmental. It moves progressively from one stage to
another. It has a beginning but no end. It’s ongoing. A program, on the other
hand, is a succession of actions carried out within a structured order that has
a beginning and a predefined end.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="A1.p3">
      <p>Q. Is one year long enough for carrying out this process?</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="A1.p4">
      <p>A. No. In Galilee Jesus took three years to form his disciples in his new way of
life. Compare this process, for example, to capital funds campaigns that are
conducted in dioceses and parishes. They usually take 3 years or more. Formation
in Christ’s new way of life is also a “capital campaign” requiring a lifetime
for becoming a saint and serving our neighbor.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="A1.p5">
      <p>Q. Is the pastor involved in this process? If so, how, when, where?</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="A1.p6">
      <p>A. YES! He together with key people (example, the pastoral council) find
qualified parishioners who are willing to serve as lay leaders of the process,
and other lay persons to begin the establishment of Small Ecclesial Faith
Communities (SEFCs) throughout the parish. He need not get involved in
details. He gives it leadership, and above all shows interest and support.
As often as possible and despite many demands, he should visit the different
SEFCs once in awhile when they hold their spiritual formation sessions,
encourage them, pray with them, answer their questions, and help them keep their
focus.
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10925 **** -->He is to preach on the process with enthusiasm and conviction, as often as he
deems it helpful to the people. In his remarks he is encouraged to choose some
points from the stage his parishioners are working through, and which he feels
will most benefit them. This also applies to the material in Part II,
Authoritative Sources. On Sunday the people in the pews who are not yet involved
have a right to be informed about the process and invited, in fact urged, to
join and participate in a SEFC.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="A1.p7">
      <p>Q. How many sessions for spiritual formation can be, or should be, drawn from
the material presented in each of the 5 stages and in Authoritative Sources?</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="A1.p8">
      <p>A. As many as there are paragraphs. The material in both parts is so abundant
that it is, relatively speaking, inexhaustible, and of course repeatable. What
the Matrix 12 and members of SEFCs seek is in-depth not superficial formation in
faith and holiness. Each of the 5 stages provides material for multiple
formation sessions, one Stage has 20, another 43 sessions, and so on.
Materials for formation sessions in Part II, Authoritative Sources are taken
entirely from magisterial documents. Under each paragraph or segment you will
find these letters: R-D-S in bold. They mean Reflection, Development and
Sharing. Members of SEFCs should follow these three steps as they did in Part I.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="A1.p9">
      <p>Q. Does the CLCC process have criteria to measure success or failure as it
carries out each of the stages?</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="A1.p10">
      <p>A. Each of the 5 stages has built-in goals, or targets to reach. Criteria for
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10950 **** -->the general goal are: how well or poorly was the stage carried out; did it
attain what it was supposed to attain? For example, in Stage 1, did twelve
gifted people respond to the “call” to be members of the Matrix, the lay group
which leads the parish through the CLCC process? Did enough parishioners respond
to the invitation to form one, two, three or more Small Ecclesial Faith
Communities for a start of the process? Not to reach these goals the first time
around is not failure, but a signal to continue to recruit.
Each stage also contains intermediate objectives. These are specific actions
that are carried out as exactly as possible within the formation session so
everyone in the SEFC gets the full benefit. For example, does the moderator
start and end the session on time; is the reflection issue clear to all; is
enough time given to quiet time; do all or most participants get a chance to
share their insights; does the moderator politely cut off long-winded sharing;
are the hymns, prayers and intercessions appropriate? More importantly, do the
participants feel they are growing spiritually and gaining better knowledge of
the faith?
Recommended is that each SEFC chooses a recorder to keep track of how well or
poorly goals and objectives are attained. This record is helpful for review and
can induce the group to strive for excellence in their formation. It tells
participants how they are conducting the formation sessions, what needs
improvement, and how to make the sessions run smoothly to the best advantage of
all.</p>

      <p>Q. What is the connection between the National Catholic Conference for Total
Stewardship and Celebrating Life as a Catholic Christian?
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 10975 **** --></p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="A1.p12">
      <p>A. In 1980 the National Catholic Conference for Total Stewardship (NCCTS) was
founded by Francis A. Novak, a Redemptorist priest, with approval of the NCCB,
now called the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). Its purpose
is to promote the biblical concept of stewardship in its totality. Stewardship
has been and still is widely used by dioceses and parishes for fund raising,
increased offertory appeals and capital funds campaigns, under the banner of 3
Ts: Time, Talent and Treasure.
Fr. Novak and the NCCTS felt compelled to explore the deeper implications of
stewardship in Sacred Scripture. Under the guidance of expert biblical scholars,
the NCCTS learned that the Old and New Testaments are a fascinating account of
how God “practices” holistic stewardship in creation through his providential
care of the universe and the planet earth. The three components of stewardship
found in both testaments are the good news (Evangelization), holiness of life
(Discipleship) and service to the Lord and his people (Stewardship). The Bible’s
three components have become the template of the NCCTS and its CLCC
process. They are living terms of a trilogy of transcendent realities that are
inextricably linked. In 1986 the language chosen to express the three realities
was Total Stewardship.
Expressive as the NCCTS thought the new title was, response to it was limited
but it did stir curiosity in many quarters. In 1990 a new language was developed
to convey that Total Stewardship has an uplifting quality: joy in celebrating
Christ as the Way, the Truth and the Life for his pilgrim people on earth. The
new title was The Christian Celebration of Life (CCL). The new title did arouse
a wide reception of the process. But some times it was mistaken for something
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 11000 **** -->else, for a pro-life group and even an offshoot of Alcoholics Anonymous. Thus
another name change was needed.
The new name for this total stewardship process came in 1998: Celebrating Life
as a Catholic Christian (CLCC). The NCCTS now feels this newly named process
expresses not only the biblical triad of Evangelization, Discipleship and
Stewardship, but also “New Evangelization”, “Call to Holiness” and
“Communion,” goals which the Second Vatican Council, Pope John Paul II, the
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and Benedict XVI have called for
repeatedly and passionately for God’s people in today’s world of conflicting
cultures.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="A1.p13">
      <p>Q. With the name change were any adjustments made to the process: its focus,
goals and manner of carrying out the Church’s mission of New Evangelization?</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="A1.p14">
      <p>A. The name change seems to excite the human spirit. It opens the imagination to
new possibilities and challenges like “I’m going to grow in holiness, me?” and
“we’ll reach out to help lapsed Catholics return to the faith, terrific!”
Indeed, the process has been given a substantial revision and its content has
been expanded. Each stage makes formation in holiness, in doctrine and in
pastoral outreach clearer. Readers of this manual will be helped immensely in
Celebrating their Lives as Catholic Christians.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="A1.p15">
      <p>Q. What is the cost for implementing this process in a parish?</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="A1.p16">
      <p>A. There is no set fee. However, cost is in the purchase of the CLCC books for
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 11025 **** -->the pastor, the lay leaders and all members of Small Ecclesial Faith
Communities. Based on experience the best way to go is for the parish to
purchase the needed number of manuals at a bulk rate, and then request each
participant to purchase a copy so as reimburse the parish. Without a book in
hand participants will find it impossible to carry out their formation. The idea
to buy one or two books and run photocopies each week for the 12 lay leaders and
members of SEFCs, as an economy measure, has been tried before with disastrous
results. The end result is not an economy measure - it costs more in time and
paper. Handout sheets get lost. People need a complete, bound book.
Having a personal copy allows each person to study from his own book, get an
idea of the structure of the process and the order of how formation sessions are
carried out, and allows participants to use their free time to quick-read the
contents before going to the next week’s session.
Special cost arrangements can be negotiated with the National Catholic
Conference for Total Stewardship on an as needed basis.</p>

      <p>A. Go to Stage 2, titled Formation of Disciples and Apostles in the CLCC

      <p>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE

1. Definitions
“Adaptation” means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or
phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other
form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes
a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this
License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work,
performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with

of this License.
“Collection” means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or
other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,
which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in
unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting
separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into
a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered
an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
“Distribute” means to make available to the public the original and copies of
the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of
ownership.
“Licensor” means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s)
the Work under the terms of this License.

individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in
the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other
persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform
literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a
phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the

the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a
variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
literary or artistic work.

has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work,
or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights
under this License despite a previous violation.
“Publicly Perform” means to perform public recitations of the Work and to
communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process,
including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make
available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may
access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to

any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label,
demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For
example, a translation could be marked “The original work was translated from

are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in
Section 4(d).
4. Restrictions.
The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited
by the following restrictions:</p>

      <p>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this
License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)

terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute
or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 11225 **** -->not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the
ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the
Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If
You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c),
as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
required by Section 4(c), as requested.</p>

be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in
connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.</p>

pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 11250 **** -->publishing entity, journal) for attribution (“Attribution Parties”) in
Licensor’s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the
name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to
the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section
3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
the Adaptation (e.g., “French translation of the Work by Original Author,” or

by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as
prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance
of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose
of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor

LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon

received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will
not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain

Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that

      <p>8. Miscellaneous
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the

conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to
the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
<!-- %**** clcc-manual.tex Line 11350 **** -->make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License
were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979),
the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO
Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take
effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of
rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not
granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in
the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights
under applicable law.</p>
